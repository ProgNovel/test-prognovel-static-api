What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.

“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.

“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.

The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.

“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”

The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.

“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.

He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.

As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.

After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.

“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang for their main family.”

“Sure.”

Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.

<novel-trivia novel="trivia">

Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.

</novel-trivia>

Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre arrangements, and her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. From how extravagant their approach in dealing with festive and catering contractors was, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.

Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.

Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys, very popular for those who wanted to get laids.

Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.

“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen. It seemed no matter how tomboy his cousin was being a housewife was her biggest talent after all.

“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.

“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.

“You--” Mila hissed.

“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira shook his head. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”

“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”

“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But refusing her now he’d never know what the girl would do, so he unwillingly did what she said.

Mila didn’t care what Shira had in mind. While her hands finishing the wrap of the rendang, she thought of Malikh Family, suddenly a sneer appeared on her face; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.

“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”

Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.

Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.

The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.

Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.

She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.

Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.

However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.

“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.

“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”

“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.

“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”

“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”

Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.

Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.

“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”

“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”

_Slap!!_

The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.

“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”

One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”

The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.

Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.

“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”

“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”

“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”

“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.

The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.

His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.

After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”

The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.

After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.

“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.

“Aunty?”

“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”

Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”

The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”

“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.

The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.

Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.

“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.

“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.

“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”

The old man vigorously shook his head.

“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”

“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”

The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.

“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”

“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.

An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”

“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”

The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.

Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.

Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.

“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”

The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.

“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”

“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.

“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”

“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”

“If you know why you still stand there?”

“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”

Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.

As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.

“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”

The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.

Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”

“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.

In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.

“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”

Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.

“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.

“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”

“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.

The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”

Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.

“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”

Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.

Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”

_Paak!_

From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”

While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.

“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.

_Splash!_

The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.

“Please get out,” Bhela said.

Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.

“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”

_Splash!!_

Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.

“Young lady…”

“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”

---

The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.

“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”

“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.

“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”

Shira shrugged his shoulders again.

Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.

“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”

“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.

“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.

Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.

“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”

Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”

Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.

“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.

“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”

“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”

Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.

A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.

It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.

“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.

Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.

“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.

Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.

“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.

“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.

Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.

“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.

“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”

“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”

Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”

“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.

“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”

It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.

“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”

No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.

He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”

“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.

“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”

“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”

“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”

“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”

“Oh, is this your opinion?”

“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”

Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”

“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.

“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.

“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”

“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”

Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.

“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.

“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.

The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.

“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.

“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.

The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.

“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.

Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.

“He’s heading this way…”

“Ah, yes, apparently.”

Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”

From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.

“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.

The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”

Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.

Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”

“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.

“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.

“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.

Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.

“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.

“Tuut! Wrong!”

Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.

“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”

Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”

They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”

Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”

Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.

So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.

Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”

“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”

“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”

Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”

“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”

“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.

“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”

Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”

“Hoho, of course not.”

As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”

It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”

“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”

“Skin care?!”

Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”

With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”

Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”

“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.

“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”

The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.

Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”

“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.

“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.

“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”

Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”

“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.

“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.

Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.

“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.

Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”

Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”

The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.

Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.
