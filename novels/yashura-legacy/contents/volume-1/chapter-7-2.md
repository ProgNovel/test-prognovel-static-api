Yashura Family had a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story was leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what an educated man could see from this Level 3 Novice trash.

But Yashura Family happily let them in when the foreigner told them he knew Kurusiya. Kurusiya was Yashura Family’s guard captain so in the end critics could only say that Yashura Family was merely lucky in connection.

Connection or not, that didn’t matter. Since the expert said that there was a chance he might pick Yashura Family’s heir Shira Yashura as a disciple of his school. Also, he said that he wanted to meet with a Nalaq.

“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First, it’s a _she_, not _he_. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. Anything lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”

Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.

“My standard is pretty high, alright? Consult with how loaded those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.

“I’m being serious here,” Shira sighed.

“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are the real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”

“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”

“Because those women were hiding. Bet those Elzhier men don’t know they’re living with vixens. You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”

“Forget about it, it’s not important--”

“Boobs are important, ey!”

Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic, “My uncle already knows you’re crashing here. One of these days he’ll wonder why a Nalaq would hide in his backyard without him knowing.”

“Isn’t that because you still want to rob me out of my wallet?”

So all this time the Nalaq was aware he was being tricked out of his wealth with these chess games. Shira didn’t want to admit that. He forcefully returned to the topic instead, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can suppress rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they become a pain in the ass. Help me out, will you?”

“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”

“You become a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.

“Was I? Speaking of ass,” the Nalaq pondering, “that girl from yesterday has quite a big bubbly butt. Noiice ass….”

After he said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defense, resulting in his king trapped in three different directions.

“Checkmate.”

“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chessboard. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about ass to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”

“No, it is not.”

“You sneaky bastard. Ain’t you got me good,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. \
“Distracting me with topics about butts. Really, man, that’s some pretty sick psychological tactic you got there.”

Shira shrugged. He didn’t want to argue with this moron.

Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want to rob me this time? Money again? I prepared some Kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”

Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”

“No boobs, no good. Man boobs not counted. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls taking their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”

“How many times do I have to tell you--”

“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”

Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.

“I can hear some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth as if he didn’t want people to lips-reading what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”

“Big... seriously...”

“I’m serious! The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”

After he said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure blurred into the thin air.

Shira Yashura sighed. He was indignant that he mumbled to himself, “Really, he always makes a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?”

When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.

He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.

“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”

He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.

“Where is it again?”

He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.

“Oh, there it is” he touched it--

_BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!_

An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree roots, he could only hug his head, waiting for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered were nowhere to be found. He cocked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirt and uprooted trees. The whole hill became a shithole kind of a mess.

Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.

As carefree as he always was, Good-Natured Spirit was all grinning, said, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrance left behind.”

Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burned along with him.

“Sure you don’t want it?”

“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”

“Yeah? You mean this? Them babes said exorcism fire or something.”

Shira really didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.

“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until now. Goodbye.”

“Leaving already? Where’d you want to go?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.

Shira scratched his head. It seemed that this bastard Nalaq was too tough for even exorcism flames. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever. He didn’t care anymore. He took a good look at the ruin around him. He said, “You just can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”

There was no hard refusal this time. Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether they were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming in frustration as he returned back to Yashura Family.

---

In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, formed a circle as they sat cross-legged. They were discussing the explosion that had just occurred.

“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever. Else, the consequence shall be dire!” Sir Baront Staterwind said, his voice a bit stern. He was confident before this, but now his expression was a little helpless. He continued, “Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school. Please remember this.”

“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” although he said that, Patriarch Shuro Yashura had the manner that looked like he would jump around like a monkey at any moment.

Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you’d think!”

The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If Shira did lose a limb, the boy’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust. Patriarch Shuro had his breath taken away thinking of this.

It’d be a giant tragedy for him to lose Shira since the boy, as the heir, as the blood-related nephew, was the only one who would inherit his love for coconuts--or so he thought.

Sir Baront Staterwind looked at them. He merely said that he could recommend the boy, Shira, as his school’s disciple, even his own pupil, if he could really communicate properly with Nalaqs. But he underestimated how eager these villagers would send their boy to study outside. He thought since this family employed a fine warrior like Kurusiya their temperament ought to be cool and rational. Looking at them properly, what he saw was a scene where family elders and their patriarch went full _quack-quack-quack_ like a bunch of motherless baby ducks. He sighed knowing this might become a little bit messy.

Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.

“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.

Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. He immediately returned after the incident happened. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”

“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”

“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”

“He still got his arm?”

“He still got his arm, Patriarch Yashura.”

“Then…” Patriarch Shuro Yashura wiped sweat from his forehead, recalling those accident he read from stories, then asked carefully, “is he still remembering who he is?”

Who knew, maybe the kid suddenly got amnesia and somehow became a genius like heroes in stories. Remembering his past lives or something.

“He even remembers that he already ate breakfast this morning, I’m sure he’s fine, Patriarch Yashura.”

For some reason, Patriarch Yashura was disappointed hearing the last reply.

“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”

After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.

Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack’s descent major family employed western-style butlers. The man didn’t even look like he came from the west. He thought this family was already odd enough to employ an eastern Kaya man as a captain guard many years ago, but seeing this he reckon Yashura Family was quite tolerant to foreigners than any other family.

Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was covered in dirt.

“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”

Patriarch Shuro Yashura quickly pulled this nephew of his to sit beside him.

“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”

Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”

Shira knew it would come to this. He thought he was prepared but he quickly realized he wasn’t as smooth as he wanted it to be. “_Cough, cough_… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”

“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked suddenly.

The boy blinked in confusion. “Is there any difference in what I called him?”

“Yes,” Sir Baront vaguely nodded, “it’s common for Nalaqs being kings and heroes when they are still alive since the revival as a Nalaq requiring a ritual with very considerable resources to perform. The ritual also has to be done twice when the person died and later when he’d have to be revived, so naturally with the sacrifice of countless wealth and continuous decades of efforts of their whorsippers, Nalaqs with titles ought to be old and awesome heroes in the past.”

“I’m not sure… as far as I know, he doesn’t have a title, he didn’t say anything about being a king,” Shira dragged his words. He was sure that pervert moron wasn’t a king, but he sometimes boasted about being some hero with unparalleled finesse with dozens of world class beauties beside him--something that he took as that Good-For-Nothing Spirit lying out of his mouth, because whenever he asked him for proof, the pervert would elude with excuses he didn’t remember any of their names. “At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He’s rather casual and told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”

“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard.

“Yes, I think so.” Shira nodded. His solemn expression was too perfect.

Then Sir Baront Staterwind asked, “So, Young Master Shira, I reckon the explosion just now was an accident?”

“Yes. An accident--I was there.”

“He didn’t really intend to blast the hill into smithereens, am I right?”

“Yes, yes.”

That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this pervert Nalaq into smithereens.

Sir Baront Staterwind barraged more questions, and Shira would reply with a “yes, yes, yes” while his head eagerly nodded like a chicken having a feast on a ground full of rice.

After that Sir Baront concluded his hypothesis he got from Shira’s replies. “Since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaches you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with them unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “My disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since your Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, even if we can’t make him making contract with Young Master Shira, at the very least I can ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”

“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.

“As expected of such expert!”

“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”

“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”

They circled Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.

Shira, in the meantime, managed to sneak away from the scene. He then looked back and scratched his head. The scene was his uncle the patriarch leading men to flood the embarrassed Sir Barront Staterwind with heavy flatteries. Then Sir Baront would magnanimously claim that since the Nalaq already had a good-natured heart, then him lending a hand would akin to a passerby lifting a mere finger. It was a trivial task at all.

Shira hid away. Guilt flashed briefly on his eyes. He then swiftly escaped through the neighbor’s alley as if someone was chasing him for debts.

Meanwhile, Yulong looked again towards the direction Shira escaped. He was the only one noticed the boy sneaking out. For an old butler watching the young master grow like him, Yulong could only shake his head for his young master acting himself as always.

As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone talked about it.

Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village for one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt they didn’t have the leisure to spend time in the countryside now that the pest that was young nouble Blackwood had gone. They let Bhela play her part as hospitable host to walk them off until they reached the carriage that would carry them off to the next village.

“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said to the girl, “if you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”

Bhela was a smart girl anyway. Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. The girl’s reply was flat without flattery, but Madame Sylvia could feel gratitude coming out the girl’s lips.

“Madame Sylvia, Mister Harrington, please take care.”

The carriage set off. Before the main gate of Badril Village, guards on duty and the passerby witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen. It was known in the village that even the yesterday’s visiting noble didn’t receive the Malikh’s Young Lady’s respectful bow.

“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”

“If you said so,” Mister Harrington said half grumbled.

The sky was clear blue. The scenery was filled with green. The weather around this part was perfect; they could call it a leisure outing rather than a tiresome trip across the rocky mountain. There were no bandits lurking around on the mountainous road from Badril Village. No monsters occasionally came out, proving that the lands around Badril Village well-protected. And so their journey was smooth without disturbance.

Hours after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. They encountered many passing carriages before, but this one catched the eyes quite easily. Well-decorated with golden-colored plates, guards trotting on horses left and right, it was obvious that a noble was traveling inside it.

The foreigner couple looked at the carriage’s emblem closely. They noticed it was the same as the black noble carriage they saw in Badril Village.

“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~

Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~

Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~

Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~

The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”

A young lady with a baby face that complemented her childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending to be deaf or not. She was completely disinterested with anything else beside singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies. There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment.

Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to see the Blackwood Family’s emblem already. Also, they happened to know Lyla.

“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”

“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised her name being called out of nowhere. But after looking right and left, she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”

“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.

“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.

“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always acting like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped the title of young lady when talking to this unreasonable girl.

“Um!” Lyla nodded firmly. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?”

“Lyla!”

It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning would enter her right ear and only to leave straight from the left one.

“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.

Lyla also shrilled, “Good morning to you too!!!”

Mister Harrington was too lazy to even bat an eye on this brief encounter. “Why would you worry about some kid playing around in her carriage? They got guards. Carriage that expensive would definitely have an elastic metal bumper installed to suppress tremor. She won’t bite her tongue.”

“You said that even though it’s Lyla you were talking about?”

The encounter ended with Lyla waving her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so mischievous that the troubles she had involved in made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once. It was only because Bhela put words to her friends, who would later put words to the higher ups, that Lyla managed to stay until the last trip of the seminars.

Madame Sylvia had a headache thinking about it. It was no wonder that Bhela wouldn’t actively kick the troublesome noble from before. Turned out, the horny mutt actually was this naughty little girl’s brother all along.

“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing as a luxury black carriage entered the village.

The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”

In the Ngajen Ceremony before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road. But today was different. Even a bunch of running kids making a tail behind them. The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed these commoners in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them vigorously, shouting at one runny nose boy she accidently got eye contact with. “Don’t you think bunnies are cute as kitties? Or do you like cats more?”

The kid didn’t answer. He instead was forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage pass through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never seen nobles in their lives. Locals were awkward of them and didn’t know what to do. So they’d bow because that's how commoners do in books and stories.

“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”

Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. She vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on. She even waved around to the running children that the carriage escorts tried to shoo away. She was greeting every locals whenever she had the chance to. After all, these were the people who lived around her friend Bhela. Some of them might help her catch some bunnies.

Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.

“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arrive without me receiving them?!”

He hadn’t yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to find the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually _weirdly_ friendly.

“So, actually, nobles actually loved cats and rabbits!”

“Yes, how weird!” someone clicked his tongue, “I don’t understand those nobles, what so good about noisy cats and wild rabbits? Them annoying little pests. Clearly nobles are living in a different world than us!”

The Village Head, who could only see people dispersed, was confused. What was this cats and rabbits all about?

Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young noble lady she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.

“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.

“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had **Haste**, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.

“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.

“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.

“For me? Really?”

“Drink slowly…”

_Glug glug glug_. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.

“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!

“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.

“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted hurriedly. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. Heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s germ!

“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler with the gaze that neither friendly nor too polite.

“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how expensive it was.

“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchoo!!!”

“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.

“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”

“Where’s your medicine now?”

“Oh. I threw it away last night.”

Bhela shook her head.

“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.

Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Bhela. Bhela gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim “Thank you, Sir Butler. It was very helpful of you.”

The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.

“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”

“Star fruits! Woohooo!”

The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue-blooded friend from the city. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.

“Young lady is… finally… finally…”

“She finally has a friend…”

“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”

---

Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it was because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeping out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. At the very least, they should steal a glance the magnificent carriage of Blackwood Family with eyes filled with boundless envy and jealousy. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. But she was just country bumpkin. Truly a country girl who didn’t know her place. She even brazenly patted Young Lady Blackwood’s head like she was some snotty little girl! That was why Butler Tim didn’t like the girl with surname Malikh.

However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.

Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.

Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.

“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”

Young girls were like this. If being told that a rock was trendy amongst peers in upper class above them they’d treat it as a gem.

“You pass some cookie store? When?!” but then snotty Lyla would act surprised.

Butler Tim gave a glance to this young lady he supposed to serve. His heart was aggrieved, for a smart man like him, serving a young lady with a not-so-smart brain like this Young Lady Lyla. Really, what a waste of his smart talent!

After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was a noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.

“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”

What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. This was how it usually was done when Bhela received snacks and there was a drooling Lyla beside her. So of course Bhela couldn’t reject the biscuits.

The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.

And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.

In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.

“Only two tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim by the end of the afternoon.

The butler was enjoying a glass of tea. He was served by the maid that was supposed to be at the side of the young lady noble as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”

“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”

Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon his smartness being validated, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fellow, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”

Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.

“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looking peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to exercise our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! Poaching people at the same time! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”

“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.

“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of the main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with Ghalim Malikh’s blood family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”

Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proved to endanger his smart plan, a smart person like him wouldn’t be able to sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”

“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.

“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”

“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain a foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”

“And that is?”

“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to the main family’s faction!”

Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fell short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. At the very least latching themselves to a noble family would be a very popular narrative amongst the new generations of the villagers. The Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.

It was barely a half-smart plan, but Butler Tim magnomously nodded at it nonetheless.

“Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”

The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”

“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invites her for a dinner.”

Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to that imbecile Elder Khasim, his ignorant but stubborn nemesis!

“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.

“What is it?”

“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”

“Hmm, what do you mean?”

What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.

When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the friendly-looking uncles who were actually the nemesis faction of Elder Jhamil’s, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.

Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side, thinking that since the young noble lady herself choose this side surely the future was there.

“Y-young Lady Lyla…”

Even Butler Tim could only watch how Lyla displayed the prowess of her bottomless belly. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.

It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. The girl did nothing wrong, but when people’s heart seeped with griviance they’d draw a line between certain people. Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Lyla Blackwood, this noisy shorty girl, was someone she deemed from the other side of the line. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.

It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla decided to play doctor a little bit.

“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Approaching the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s the medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”

Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. It was fortunate that the girl didn’t have to see the sight of Patriarch Ghalim at his worst point.

“Thank you for your help, little lady,” he weakly nodded.

“Then I’m going to feed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”

Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.

“It’s… sweet.”

“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.

“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”

As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.

“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly inserted a disclaimer, “maybe!”

Madam Malikh had her eyes watching closely her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him. She was restless, but didn’t say anything. She only looked at Lyla with her eyes pretending to be half-closed. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby. When she was there Bhela did servants work without complaint. She’d make even a little change if it could make her parents more comfortable staying in the room. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, only eat cake once a day--all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.

“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.

Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.

“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”

“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”

“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”

The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”

Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly. His face was pale, but he got his act looked like his family’s matter was more helpless than his own life that almost ended in the past few days. This made Madam Malikh hated Blackwood Family and Elder Jhamil even more.

In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Watching how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. She could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady from a viscount family….

“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”

Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”

Originally, Lyla wanted her friend to also play with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lessons or whatever. It’s very very boring….” she said, lips crooked.

“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Walking down the path of virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”

“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense to detect whether or not the conversation she had with Bhela ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff.

Promptly Lyla grabbed her new friend the bunny, bolted somewhere else before she was forced to do anything. Bhela, seeing the scene that happened many times in the past, shook her head at the girl’s behavior. Bhela continued spent her time sweeping the yard. Lyla continued wasting her time playing with bunny.

Not long after that, Bhela saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla. These girls were completely different kinds, their mouth covered with feathered fans, shinny stones inserted in their wearings whenever there were space to do so.

Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece. She came closer to hear what they were trying to talk Lyla to.

“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”

“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”

“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”

“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”

Lyla blinked her eyes as trying to decipher whatever these girls saying. The more they drawn Lyla to their sopichistated conversation, the more Lyla had her face twisted weirdly. The rabbit in her bosom even managed to escape amidst the confusion.

“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”

She swiftly ran back to her Bhela.

“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”

“What did they do?” Bhela asked.

“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in the seminars--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”

Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.

“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”

“Different? How so?”

Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.

“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were just idiots.”

“I don’t like them nonetheless!”

“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said with patient tone.

Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching them instead.

“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”

“Bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their _unique_ vocabulary.

Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for the girl.

“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.

Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”

The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela saying.

Then one of the le banjour girls held Bhela in the hand.

“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”

Their confused face changed so swiftly into an elaborate enthusiasm.

“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticatated after all. Me gusta!”

“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”

Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.

“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”

Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably due to the great demand in the south for their salt business, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.

It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.

Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same chance as her!

The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”

“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.

“If that’s the case, then why does she still have no friends other than you?”

“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, acting as if she was wronged, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”

It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never judge people by the caste system. She judged people based on merits. And that she’d give merits exclusively to people who gave her delicious food.

Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”

“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.

“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”

“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”

Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.

“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one now?”

Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.

Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.

“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was the kitchen. The spirit of bunny would then come to possess her--she’d jolt, she’d sprint, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.

“What was that about?!” one of the le banjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”

“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”

“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”

Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. In the seminars, Bhela was fine, since she got famous in the circle with her talent, and her mysterious backers managed to make people vigilant from offending her. But Lyla was different. A young lady from a viscount family merely in the middle-to-low caste amongst the prodigies and royalties invited in the seminars. Lyla was made fun of so much just by doing her usual stuff that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back whenever she got into trouble. But the le banjour girls didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip.

It was no wonder that Bhela made excuses to hurriedly pull Lyla away. It was not because she was afraid of Elder Jhamil’s people intercepting her relationship with Lyla, but these delusional le banjour girls were just too much for the innocent Lyla’s education!
