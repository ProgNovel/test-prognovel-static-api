When he arrived at Yashura Family’s gate, Shira saw Yulong planting fresh torches around the road of Yashura Family. Quietly, he glanced beside him. And much to his expectation, the Good-Natured Spirit who didn’t seem to get tired from pestering him before this suddenly sneered, then floated away without having to say a farewell.

“Are there still some people around working on cleaning up the debris, Yulong?” Shira approached Yulong, showing off the braised chicken he got from the Elzhier Family. “I’ve got something for them.”

Yulong received the basket full of wrapped food. “Please go take a look at your uncle and cousin, young master. They’re in the family council. Let me handle the accommodation for volunteers now.”

Agreeing on Yulong’s suggestion, Shira then walked to the council hall. The council hall was different from the family hall--this was a place where only the elders and related family members would come to discuss an issue that was not appropriate for common family members to involved in. What welcomed him when he arrived, though, was a crowd. The crowd barely entered the hall, but this commotion confused him regardless.

“Nooo!! I am the Eldest Young Lady of this family! This is unfair!!!”

A young woman’s squeal shrilled enough to make Shira stopped his track. There he saw Mila’s bawling face bursting out of the council hall. She came to hug a wooden pillar with her eyes red with grievance, acting as if she was wronged. “What do you mean I can’t have my cosmetics anymore? How come the Eldest Young Lady like me couldn’t get my rightful allowance to buy cosmetics any longer? Don’t you know if I don’t apply my usual cosmetic at least once every three days, my skin would go back dry and rough? In Elzhier Family, even a maidservant could afford cosmetics everyday--but why couldn’t I? Why can’t I? What’s the point of being the Eldest Young Lady if some mere servants have skin more beautiful than me? What’s the point?!”

What answered her was silent. Watching at the council hall from where Shira was standing, the building looked desolate.

At that Mila’s bawling became even louder. She covered her face and cried as she stormed off from the crowd, “Waaa! Waa!! I don’t want to be Eldest Young Lady anymore!”

The scene Mila throwing a tantrum was seen by members of the family, even the servants watching the spectacle. Shira felt a headache coming from this cousin of his. At this time of hardships, the outer family members of Yashura Family would seek stability from the elders as well as the authority of the main family’s bloodline; was Mila aware that her freaking out would make all these people uneasy?

Yet just as Shira began to carry on, a middle-aged man’s bawling followed

“What do you mean I can’t cook beef rendang anymore?!” Patriarch Shuro burst out from the council hall, thick moustache wet with snot, hugging a pillar and squealing at the direction of council hall acting as if he was wronged. “In Elzhier Family, even the most lowly servants can set up a stall selling beef stew and beef satay, they butcher cows once every two days and make delicious beef muchever they wanted--but why couldn’t I? Why can’t I? What’s the point of being a patriarch if some lowly servants could cook food more delicious than me? What’s the point?!”

Covering his crying face like a little girl throwing tantrums, Patriarch Shuro stormed off with a shrill, “I don’t want to be Yashura Family Patriarch anymore!”

Shira was dumbfounded.

At this point, forget about being uneasy. The outer family members and the servants were all dumbfounded as well.

Only when Shira narrowed his eyes at them did these busibodies cough awkwardly and dispersed, acting as if they didn’t see anything.

The boy then entered the council hall. And as what he expected, the only one sitting in the hall supposed to host thirty was only an old man.

“Elder Fhantir.”

“Young Master Shira, you’ve come.”

The elder, Fhantir Yashura, was smoking old-fashioned pipe, the wrinkles on his face made him look even more evil than when he was younger. His official title was the treasurer of Yashura Family. In practice he was the most senior in the elder council, partly due to his age, but mostly because he was the one who managed everyone’s salary and the food expense Yashura Family could use. This old man decided what kind of food the family members could and couldn’t eat--for the kind of family of foodies, he was the most powerful man in the entire Yashura Family.

And this Elder Fhantir told Shira to sit down with a tone that made the receiving end felt they’d never leave the room alive.

“Is the treasury… really that bad, Elder Fhantir?” Shira asked.

“We can afford to repair almost everything except the wall, young master,” Elder Fhantir said. Seeing the amicable look on the boy’s face, the elder grumbled. “What’s with that look?”

“Please enlighten me with the situation, Elder.”

Elder Fhantir’s wrinkled face made him look unhappy, yet he explained nonetheless. “Back then, when your grandfather was still alive, he contracted a specialist tribe to erect the wall, giving the responsibility to gather the material and to construct the wall themselves. They were the descendants of an ancient Mossack builders tribe. They knew better than us, and their works were always exemplary. But everything was expensive--especially the materials. The stone to build our wall isn’t something you can get from digging river beds. They were extracted from a certain mountain one hundred miles away from here. We need to recomission them to make our wall back to its original form.”

Shira could understand the severity behind Elder Fhantir’s words. From the beginning, Yashura Family could gain a foothold as the major family because they could afford to protect their family members back when the time monster stampede and bandit attacks were as common occurrence as rain in humid season. Elzhier Family might be well-connected and wealthy, and Malikh Family might be successful gaining influence over the course of past decades, but historically, none of the two other families were more dependable than the Yashura in time of crisis. The story of his grandfather the previous Patriarch Yashura launching campaigns to eradicate volatile monster nests and exploiting Selaqs’ feral power to keep monsters at bay, as well his father Jhuro Yashura securing smooth trading routes, were stories of legend boys of the current generation often romanticized. Yashura Family was once known as the lion of Badril Village. And the sturdy wall of Yashura Family was something that the previous patriarch left behind--a standing symbol of Yashura Family’s might. Cutting corners in repairing the wall would be the same as telling people they wouldn’t be in business of being the village’s guardian anymore. At this time, especially when Elzhier Family was having the seat of the village head and Malikh Family enjoyed popularity brought by their Young Lady’s fame, Yashura Family couldn’t afford to be more left behind by having their influence and authority undermined further.

Just as Shira could imagine how serious the situation was, Elder Fhantir continued giving him bad news, “That’s only the beginning of the problem. Now we need to figure out how to contact that builder tribe. Your grandfather no longer in this world, and the last Yashura Family elder who remembered the tribe’s location would be Elder Thula.”

“Will Elder Thula come out of his retirement to help us out?”

Elder Fhantir didn’t answer immediately. Instead he busied himself by refreshing his smoking tobacco. Shira thought that the elder wouldn’t be willing to answer this, but Elder Fhantir then said, “I’d rather leave hole in our wall than call that old bastard back.”

Shira was troubled seeing Elder Fhantir’s mood dropped. Elder Fhantir explained more.

“The old fart has something better to do than worrying our internal affair,” he said, making Shira recall that the story about his grandfather’s two trusted aides, one was elder who managed the internal finance and politics and the other one managed external affairs--both whom were ferocious in their own ways. Elder Fhantir said after a long exhale of smoke, “It’s not that we can’t do anything without Elder Thula. This builder tribe should be alive and well, their crafts passed down for generations. All we have to do is to track them down and leash a new contract.”

“Is all this really that expensive for you to confisticate Mila’s cosmetics.”

“It’s because those cosmetics handcrafted by Grandpa Piss that makes it complicated,” Elder Fhantir looked solemn, “The one who connected your grandfather to that builder tribe was Granny Niu Elang from Elzhier Family in the first place. These women from Elzhier Family were feisty, your grandfather did a lot to receive help from them. Now we need to ask her favor again. Elzhier Family wants Mila’s cosmetics this time.”

Shira fell to his thought. Was his grandfather asked a favor from someone in the all woman sect hidden in Elzhier Family back then? Women sure did love cosmetics.

Elder Fhantir impatiently said again, “Fool. Why freak out just because a damned cosmetic? You people could just ask then more from Grandpa Piss later, he won’t dare to reject us if he knew we’re having a damn hole in our wall.”

Shira recalled how Mila behaved pampered before the friendly Grandpa Piss. It did seem that he might personally concoct cosmetics for Mila for the second time. “What about my uncle’s ruckus?”

“Didn’t I say everything was expensive? I’m going to sell all of our cows on our ranches. Elzhier Family wealthy enough to take them all. We also need the surplus from this deal for our saving to build roads that your grandfather couldn’t manage to build before his death. Road--that’s your grandfather unfulfilled wish. It’s better than having these money squandering fools thinning out our treasury everytime we celebrate Ngajen Ceremony.”

Unlike his cousin and his uncle, Shira didn’t question Elder Fhantir’s decision. Owning a cow ranch was a symbol of influence in Badril Village, mainly because with stock of beef they could gain good impressions and reputation by cooking delicious food during Ngajen Ceremony. If Yashura Family sold all of their cows to Elzhier Family, it’d be the same as they surrendered the competition to their own rival. But Yashura Family still had goats. It was not like they couldn’t make do without beef. No matter how much he liked beef, in Shira’s opinion, repairing the wall was more important than the privilege of hosting Ngajen Ceremony with beef rendang.

“You’re the first one from our family’s main bloodline who’s not freaking out for nothing. Saying this much to your uncle is useless. You’ll just make do,” Elder Fhantir said. His impression on the gullible Patriarch Shuro really that bad.

Beyond what already explained, Elder Fhantir wasn’t willing to share it with a junior like Shira regardless his status of the young master. Just when Shira about to leave the council hall, Elder Fhantir gave him a message, “An injured lion needs others’ help to survive, young master. But it doesn’t mean it won’t be able to roar again the next time.”

Shira nodded. After stepping out of the hall, he looked back in pensive. Yashura Family members and other elders had long referred to meeting face-to-face with Elder Fhantir for a death punishment. Just a glare from the mean-looking old elder could make legs turn jelly. But in a hard time, the boy actually was glad that Yashura Family had the final defense that was heartless enough to face a crisis with adversity--as his uncle, he thought he wouldn’t be able to come with decisive decisions like this. Shira rubbed his nose. Looked at the passing family members and servant. Then looked back at the family hall. He wondered how many more people in Yashura Family who shared the same thought as him regarding of Elder Fhantir.

The mess happened in Yashura Family made Malikh Family look very tranquil. By the next morning, Lyla Blackwood already was familiar enough with Malikh Family’s place she ran joyfully toward the kitchen with the tip of her toes.

“Sistah Bhela, yuuhuuu~ yuhuu~~” Lyla greeted as she deeply took a whiff. The aroma of peanut sauce satay early in the morning was heavenly. Bhela was squatting alone in front of the kitchen, waving a fan for grilling satay, occasionally flipping bamboo skewered chicken satays. Lyla came to squat beside her, staring at the halfway done chicken satay, asking, “Sis Bhela, you’re making satay for your family’s breakfast?”

People around here didn’t usually eat satays for breakfast. But Lyla was hyped for satays recently, so Bhela decided to begin the day with one. “These are for us. Aunties inside are making chicken soup, they left me some chicken breasts to cook as I see fit.”

“How lucky! Thank you aunties in the kitchen!” Lyla shouted.

From the kitchen window flashed one of the aunties’ faces, replied her with a laugh, “Don’t mention it. You’re not staying here forever, Young Lady Lyla, so might as well eat every one of Mossack's original recipes!”

“Ih wao! Such good aunties! Malikh Family aunties are the best!”

Lyla was waiting for the chicken satay to cook. She couldn’t stop staring at the chicken juice dropping on burnt coconut shells below, which then later steamed and released the aroma of peanut sauce goodness. Not much time passed, Lyla droll began to well in her mouth.

“Sis, can I fan satay too?”

Instead of giving Lyla the fan she had on her hand, Bhela said to her, “Go ask aunties for a fan for you. And also ask whether the marinated carps ready to be grilled.”

“Is the fish for the two of us too?” Lyla asked with glimmering eyes.

“Yes.”

“Waawoooww!”

The little happiness Lyla found in this humble village was that she could eat satay and grilled fish for breakfast. Back in Blackwood Family manor, Lyla wouldn’t even dare to dream for this to happen. Kitchens in Blackwood manors were forbidden for Lyla to enter, but the Malikh’s kitchens were forever open for her to plunder.

And so Lyla entered the kitchen to fetch some fan for grilling. But kitchen aunties stopped her to give her snacks and crackers. So instead of returning to Bhela immediately, Lyla sat on a wooden table, munching a salty cow skin cracker the aunties shoved her, swinging her legs back and forth as she lazily the drama that unfolding in the kitchen; the old woman in charge of making sambal, Granny Litha, was scolding some haughty young maidservants.

“How many times I have to tell you, don’t throw away edible cabbages!” Granny hished as she knocked her walking stick on the ground to make a protesting noise. “How many times should I tell you, you pampered bunch of babies?!”

“But Granny Litha,” one of the maidservants talked back, “Elder Jhamil ordered us to throw away all vegetables that are not fresh anymore!”

Another young maidservant followed suit, “Yes, Elder Jhamil said that. He also said that the noble guest used to eat food differently than us, so we all need to make sure we control our food quality before presenting them to the noble guest from Blackwood Family. You may not know this, Granny Litha, but nobles can’t eat dirty food!”

At the same time as the young maidservant fiercely arguing with the grumpy old lady, Lyla knocked the wooden bowl that held all the skin crackers aunties gave her, accidentally dropping them onto the floor. After making sure right and left that nobody realized her blunder, she squatted, picked the crackers on the floor, and patted them to get rid of any dirt.

“Five second rule!” she rationalized. She then shoved them all quickly into her mouth. _Crunch crunch crunch._ She continued to watch, acting as if the heated arguments didn’t have anything to do with her.

Because Granny Litha wasn’t someone with a golden tongue, in the end, all she only could was grumply use the oldest card in her sleeves--”Hmph! Back when I was your age, to eat a leaf of cabbage was already a blessing! You young’uns really don’t know how lucky you are to live in a time of peace where you don’t have to worry about monster stampedes and bandit raids! Back then, don’t even mention rice, there were times that we didn’t even have millets to fill our bellies! Us old folks were so poor and hungry that we had to eat grass for our daily food!”

Everyone in the kitchen already heard Granny Litha’s “back when I was your age” scolding for the thousand times, so her words entered their right ears then left through the left ears immediately. Well, everyone was, except Lyla.

“I want to ask something, Aunty Yaya,” Lyla said as she tugged the aunty’s sleeve who stood beside her.

“What is it you want to know, Young Lady Lyla?” the aunty called Aunty Yaya smiled, while seamlessly transferring one of the cinnamon buns on the tray that she had onto Lyla’s hand.

Before proceeding with her question, Lyla quickly gobbled the cinnamon bun like a squirrel. After the bun was gone she finally asked, “Is it true that people in Badril Village eat grass?”

Smile on the Aunty Yaya’s face froze. She looked at this girl asking that kind of question with such big, googly eyes. If she gave her a wrong reply, wouldn’t the girl think that Badril Village was such an uncivilized place for eating grass?

“There are actually some types of grasses that can be eaten, don’t you know, Young Lady Lyla?” the aunty said with the straightest smile she could put on her face. “One particular grass, for example, called Paku Grass, which you can find easily in Badril Mountain’s valley. While Paku Grass usually boiled with herbs and dried fruits, its taste can change if you chew it raw thirty times--it becomes sweet just like how rice tastes if you chew it long enough!”

“Iih wao! I didn’t know that!” Lyla exclaimed as her mouth gapped with “O” shape. Aunty Yaya nodded as she was glad that this sweet noble young lady wasn’t disgusted after knowing some people ate grass--which was something poorer folks had done to survive until past two decades, when the routes to trade were secured and the economy improved thanks to Jhuro Yashura’s and Ghalim Malikh’s gang living outside as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">road warriors</span>.

Not much long after that Bhela entered the kitchen because she felt Lyla forgot about the fan and the marinated fish. But soon she realized the uncomfortable mood around the kitchen. She heard Granny Litha yell something before. She too had grown dull with Granny’s “back when I was your age” scolding, so she didn’t remember what that was about.

“What happened?” Bhela asked Lyla.

Instead of answering, Lyla asked something unrelated, “Sis Bhela, don’t you know you actually can eat grass?”

“Who said that?”

“Granny Litha!”

Thinking about it again, Bhela did recall Granny Litha yelling something about grass.

“And Aunty Yaya said grass can become sweet if you chew it thirty times!”

Bhela was angry at Aunty Yaya. Not because she was lying to Lyla, but because what she said was actually true. Eating grass was something Granny Litha said when she was furious, as people really did eat Paku Grass to survive everytime disaster struck in the old days. But nowadays nobody in Badril Village was so poor they had to resort eating grass anymore. Bhela didn’t know how to explain this to Lyla so she changed the topic back instead. “Grilled fish is better. We need to grill our fish outside. There’s too much smoke inside. Look, your eyes have already teary.”

Lyla’s eyes indeed was red because the smoke from wooden fire pots.

“Where’s your fan?” Bhela asked.

“All the fans are being used by aunties to cook, except one,” Lyla told Bhela what she found after watching all the aunties working when she herself was busy eating cow skin crackers.

“And where’s the fan that’s not being used to cook?” Bhela then asked.

“There!” Lyla pointed at the old granny who, while grinding chillies to make <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sambal</span>, grumpily fanned the smoke from coming to her face. It was her habit to fan herself when she was angry.

Granny Litha didn’t have any spouse or significant others in her life. She was an old maiden, the kind who wouldn’t be able to get respect from her peers, because none of her relatives had been willing to step up in her time of crisis. So usually, when others need the fan, they just ask her casually. Nobody really respected her even though her skill in making spicy <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sambal </span>was second to none. At this time even most of the younger generation of Malikh Family forgot that Granny Litha was actually Elder Jhamil’s aunt--though they lived their lives separately, and Elder Jhamil couldn’t be bothered with an aunt who stuck in the back of family kitchen for decades. In the end, Granny Litha could scold people however much she wanted to--but if there was no one to back her, she couldn’t really argue back when she was the one who was slowing others’ work.

Bhela didn’t tell Lyla to ask the fan from Granny Litha, however. She needed Granny Litha’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sambal</span> for the grilled carp after all. She gave Lyla the fan in her hands instead.

“Use this, and stop bothering aunties working. Let’s cook our fish outside now.”

Holding the fan, Lyla ran outside, yelling, “Grill fish, I’m comiiiing!”

Before following Lyla outside, Bhela came to Aunt Yaya, said, “Aunty Yaya, please don’t put any weird ideas inside Lyla’s head.”

Aunt Yaya knew the young lady was complaining because she said too much about the grass. So she replied, “I’m sorry, Young Lady Bhela. It’s just if I don’t explain clearly to her, Young Lady Lyla would think lowly for us southerners to have to eat grass during hard times.”

“Trust me,” Bhela said seriously, “that is not what she was thinking.”

Bhela later told a servant to fetch her a wholesome banana leaves directly from its tree. Although usually Lyla didn’t feel like working and doing some other boring stuff, she was surprisingly obedient when it came to her own food. She liked preparing the banana leaves because it was kind of novel for her to eat food without using a plate--they laid the cleaned banana leaves without cutting them into parts, spread white rice, and decoratively lining up chicken satay along with those sweet peanut sauce that painted the rice brown with deliciousness. Finally, the grilled carp was on top, poured with red spicy <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sambal uleg</span> that the aunties in the kitchen had prepared for them--made by Granny Litha, of course.

Turned out eating like this, even without a fork and knife that Lyla always thought was a hassle, Lyla found very satisfying and she liked it very much. Any food would feel so much good if eat with friends. The breakfast was private for the two of them. But even for the glouton Lyla, it was quite a festive she couldn’t ask for more.

_Buurrpp…_

The girl shamelessly burped while she patted her satisfied belly. “I’m pregnant with food, hihi. Look, Sistah, I’m preg--oiish oiish oiiiish… my naawse!”

Bhela always punished her with a pinch on her nose everytime she burped or did some other stupid things.

“You’re a girl, Lyla, how many times I told you to stop burping,” Bhela said.

That morning after their breakfast a young family elder came to Bhela, asking her to come to the family’s hall. Bhela was expecting for Elder Khasim to contact her, mainly due to the secret document she gave him, but she didn’t expect for Elder Khasim to work this fast.

“Lyla,” Bhela called, “do you want to join me?”

Lyla, who was busy on her knees trying to scrape the leftover satay peanut sauce on the banana leaves, raised her head, asking, “Where to?”

“Family Hall.”

“Family Hall?” Lyla’s ear perked up. Wasn’t the Family Hall the place where all the food that the kitchen made gathered in one place? “Let’s go, Sis Bhela! Let’s go eat our next breakfast today!!!”

Meanwhile, in the Malikh’s family hall, the clamors amongst the common members of the family reverberated across the hall. Elder Jhamil tried very hard to appear calm, but his reddened face betrayed him regardless.

On the opposite side, Elder Khasim calmly stroked his gray beard, his face brimmed with determination. Even his followers had hints of confidence in their eyes too. This morning, under the watchful gazes of all members of the Malikh Family, Elder Khasim accused Elder Jhamil of exploiting his position to gain benefits for himself and his own group. One must know beforehands that accusing an elder before their peers without the process of discussion in Council Hall was something unprecedented, even in the other major families. As one misstep could bite the accuser very, very badly. All this could tell that Elder Khasim wasn’t joking. He planned to go all out this very morning.

At first, when the accusation landed, Elder Jhamil’s people were angry. They barked even louder than dogs to call Elder Khasim’s character as the family elder for slandering colleagues in front of common people. But soon Elder Khasim took out a scroll, reading one by one the deficit and the part where family owned materials mysteriously gone, forcing them to shut their mouth. Elder Khasim read it down to great details. The more he read, the more common members of Malikh Family got angry instead.

“I originally didn't mind if some greedy people wanted to make some profits after their years of showing loyalty to Malikh Family,” with a biting sarcasm, Elder Khasim began his conclusion. “But one thing I couldn’t let go is the fact that our One Tulip Restaurant has lost its might and reputation in recent years. We might incompetent enough not to get proof all this years, Elder Jhamil, but nobody here was a fool.”

When Elder Khasim mentioned One Tulip Restaurant, everyone’s face turned solemn. It was fine if it was another of Malikh Family’s businesses, but One Tulip Restaurant, beside having been providing Malikh Family with quite a significant income, had been the symbol of Malikh Family’s rise many decades ago. This very restaurant was located in the nearest city in radius one hundred kilometers away, was originally a private business of the then Madam Malikh. When her husband passed away and her son too young to become the patriarch, she took control of the family and turned this simple restaurant to be a very strategic piece for Malikh Family’s expansion to the outside world. One Tulip Restaurant was the reason Malikh Family got enough wealth to build their own family’s wall in the first place, which ultimately led them to establish themselves as the third major family of Badril Village. For an official to taint such a historical place with their greed, all members of Malikh Family wouldn’t be satisfied unless they got to parade the culprit all around the village, before shoving him to a lion monster’s den or maybe even worse.

“Elder Khasim, why are you brought One Tulip Restaurant out of the sudden?” Elder Jhamil’s face was sneering, but his hidden palms couldn’t stop from sweating. “Here I sit through all of your bullshit waiting for your nonsense to over. But what did I get? More nonsense, ceh! Do you want to throw mud on my face that bad to slander me in front of the entire Malikh Family? In your bullshit report you read before never once you mentioned One Tulip Restaurant!”

“What are you saying, Elder Jhamil?” Elder Khasim just waved his hand at his opponent’s spat. “I only said that nobody here was a fool, I admit that we still haven’t found a single clue about One Tulip’s recession yet.” Actually, in the document Bhela gave him Elder Khasim found out about Elder Jhamil’s ridiculous corruption at One Tulip Restaurant. If not for the young lady’s reluctance for creating a complete chaos, Elder Khasim would gladly send this unreasonably greedy Elder Jhamil to his grave right here, right now.

Elder Khasim then turned to the crowd, said, “You all heard the proof I’ve got against Elder Jhamil’s shameless corruption. You can trust me, I got it from a very incredible trusted source. I’m going to use my position as the senior elder of the Malikh Family to impeach Elder Jhamil for this reason. The problem now, is there anyone here still willing to trust Elder Jhamil on managing One Tulip Restaurant?”

Everyone whispered to each other, but Elder Khasim knew nobody was willing to place their trust toward Elder Jhamil currently.

“Elder Khasim,” the old elder who managed the treasury opened his mouth, “I’m willing to work this old bone to check through family’s account books to validate your accusation. And I also do believe we need to relieve Elder Jhamil from his position at One Tulip Restaurant’s manager for a while--at least until we know whether Elder Khasim is telling the truth. Elder Khasim staking his reputation to impeach Elder Jhamil in the public, after all.”

“Elder, you…” Elder Jhamil was tongue-tied. This old foggy was very friendly toward him previously. He also got fat from benefits especially these past few days from Blackwood’s bribing scheme. To think even this old fox changing tune so quickly….

Since One Tulip Restaurant was mentioned, anybody in the family would immediately washed their hands before being implicated in the scandal. Regardless of whether Elder Khasim was telling the truth or not, when the two factions were going to commit an all out war, best to be spectators along with other neutral elders and watch the spectacle from the sideline.

It was at that time Bhela and Lyla arrived at the Malikh Family Hall. When a family servant announced their arrival, the squabbling elders immediately looked at the two girls. Elder Khasim wanted Bhela to sit in the elders spot to join the argument as the member of main family, but Bhela led Lyla to a spot where snacks were abundant instead. The girls had just had their breakfast--and they came here for the desserts, nothing more.

Helpless for wanting the young lady’s full support, Elder Khasim then pretended that the Young Lady Bhela Malikh wasn’t informed of the Elder Jhamil’s corruption matter, explaining, “We just argue about Elder Jhamil’s crime, Young Lady Bhela. This might be cruel to ask a girl who hasn’t yet had her coming of her age ceremony; but since your mother is busy attending on your ill father, then we incompetent elders have no choice but rely on you, young lady. Please, take a look at this proof I’ve collected from my trusted source.”

Elder Khasim stood up from his cross-legged sitting to deliver the proof to Bhela--the trusted source he referred to in his speech. Bhela originally wanted to appear solemn reading it, but Lyla just couldn’t eat brown sugar pudding without making a mess on her face, so Bhela had to take a napkin and wipe the pudding from Lyla’s face first. Instead of looking like the proper young lady with the main family’s bloodline authority, at this time Bhela looked just like a young wife having to take care her little daughter.

“Well?” after reading it, Bhela raised her head, aware of the entire family’s attention directed at her. “If this was my father, I’m sure he’s not willing to let Elder Jhamil operate One Tulip Restaurant until the suspicion is cleared.”

Elder Khasim nodded. “That is the case, young lady. My heart was bleeding when I uncovered this dirty matter to the entire family--but that is only because I think we urgently need someone else to manage One Tulip Restaurant, not Elder Jhamil!”

“Hmph!” Seeing that Elder Khasim wagging his tail in front of the young lady, Elder Jhamil harrumphed. His family was managing One Tulip Restaurant for three generations, how could he not see what the fella was really after?

Seeing that the Young Lady Malikh was now busy explaining traditional cakes to her friend Young Lady Blackwood, Elder Jhamil decided to strike first as to leave a retreating path for himself.

“Young Lady Bhela, I admit during my official duty I let some of my subordinates slip up due to my negligence--I admit guilty on some of Elder Khasim’s accusation!” he said with loud voice. “However, young lady, if you really are representing the main family, then please consider this matter carefully! One hundred years ago, Matriarch Malikh trusted One Tulip Restaurant to my grandfather, I don’t believe she’ll be happy in after life if some busybodies covet her precious legacy!”

Elder Khasim sneered at Elder Jhamil. Couldn’t this moron see that Young Lady Bhela he pleaded to was the one who actually orchestrated all this? “And then, who would you suggest to pass on your position, Elder Jhamil?”

Seeing that smug look on Elder Khasim’s face, Elder Jhamil turned vigilant. He glanced at Bhela who carefreely cracking nuts for Lyla to eat. Something wasn’t quite right, but he didn’t know what.

“Ehem,” Elder Jhamil began. “My son is an excellent young elder who recently got into service of Malikh Family’s council, young lady. He’s excellent in arithmetic and his Level and Class is also appropriate to be in position of leadership--I suggest you see him to understand how capable he is!”

“I’ve seen him. In the kitchen.” Bhela said cooly. “Anyone who doesn’t know the rules of the kitchen shouldn’t be let working into any food stall, much less a restaurant. He should stay away from One Tulip Restaurant.”

Chuckles and muffled snickers were heard from Elder Khasim’s side. Elder Jhamil’s face just got redder than he normally was.

Presenting a nephew of his, Elder Khasim confidently said, “This is someone I’d like to recommend, Young Lady Bhela. I believe my nephew’s education and honesty is something that everyone already knows. He got reputation amongst the younger generation as straight as a pole. Young Lady Bhela too, who was busy studying for two years abroad, also knew his excellence upon your return, I assume?”

“Yes,” Bhela said. She glanced at the scholarly young man beside Elder Khasim. “But can he make sambal?”

Elder Khasim, who originally smug, blinked his eyes at Bhela’s question. “Sambal? Pardon my young lady?”

“I want to know whether he knows how to make a sambal or not.”

Elder Khasim’s nephew was a scholar who had a strong grasp on arithmetic. But he never worked in the kitchen. Scratching his head, he wryly replied, “My current job isn’t requiring me to learn how to make sambal, young lady.”

Bhela was calm. She said, “No matter who’s in charge of One Tulip Restaurant, it’s gonna decline eventually. It’s because of one particular reason; in the past, One Tulip Restaurant often praised by foreigners for a place to get the best sambal in the whole southern lands, but over the years no one could replicate the original sambal. For that certain reason One Tulip Restaurant isn't as popular as it used to be. Choosing a manager is no simple matter. But the main family’s main requirement for One Tulip Restaurant’s new manager should be simple; we want someone dedicated who knows how to make a great sambal, someone who can lead One Tulip Restaurant to recover its past glory.”

Still blinking his eyes awkwardly, Elder Khasim then asked, “Young lady, do you perhaps have someone in mind to appoint as One Tulip Restaurant’s manager?”

“No,” Bhela said straightforwardly.

“Then how about--”

“But I can ask a foreigner for her opinion.”

Elder Khasim wanted to say something but Bhela went ahead asking the foreigner she mentioned, anyway.

She asked, “Who do you think makes the most delicious sambal in Malikh Family, Lyla?”

Lyla’s eyes shone. Such an easy question! “Of course it’s Granny Litha! Granny Litha’s sambal is super delicious!”

“Mm. Grandma Litha it is.”

And thus, as the Young Lady of the Malikh Family had declared, Litha Malikh, known as Grandma Litha, or Cranky Old Granny as some called her, became the manager of One Tulip Restaurant. As their presence no longer needed, Bhela pulled Lyla’s hand, said, “Let’s go, Lyla.”

Lyla stood up after she plundered cakes and pastries she was able to bring outside. They just sat there in less than three minutes, but already solved one of the biggest political battles that happened in Malikh Family’s history.

Common family members who were watching, although they hadn’t had any good impression toward cranky Granny Litha, were quite satisfied by Young Lady Bhela’s decision--mostly because they felt good upon hearing Lyla said their family’s sambal was super delicious. After all, Lyla Blackwood was a blue blood noble young lady through and through. Receiving praise from such a person made them overproud. But sophisticated ones like the elders had different reactions than common people.

“Isn’t Granny Litha that one hateful Granny who is very hard to please?” someone whispered from Elder Jhamil’s faction.

“Isn’t Granny Litha is Elder Jhamil’s blood relative aunt?” someone whispered from Elder Khasim’s side.

Upon returning back from their shock, Elder Khasim and Elder Jhamil both sprang up and shouted, “Please wait, Young Lady Bhela!”

---

Chasing across the corridor, both elders then found Bhela and Lyla already wasn’t there. Elder Khasim found himself together with his rival Elder Jhamil as he gathered his breath. Both of them harrumphed, turned around and walked away in two completely different reactions.

Elder Khasim then returned to his followers, who were anxious waiting for his return. One of them asked, “Elder Khasim, is Young Lady Bhela serious about pointing Granny Litha as the manager of One Tulip Restaurant?”

Although he too was feeling doubt and disappointment, but Elder Khasim knew Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t be joking around after secretly giving him the weapon to jab Elder Jhamil’s faction. “It seems that is the case,” he gravely nodded.

“Does Young Lady trust us in the first place?” someone asked.

“Is this how Young Lady Bhela putting us in place after making a ruckus attacking Elder Jhamil’s faction?”

“I knew it! Ah, just when we got our grip on Elder Jhamil’s weakness! Young Lady Bhela isn’t yet going through her coming of age ceremony, we should’ve invited her mother Madam Malikh instead!”

“You! Watch your mouth!” Elder Khasim furiously slapped the last person’s cheek. “It’s already good enough for a member of the main family answering our invitation, you’ve got guts to question her integrity! Don’t you know this faction is over if we offend Young Lady Bhela now?!”

The elder who got slapped was ashamed when his colleagues all stared at him. He quickly backed away. Everyone there knew they hadn’t got any chance when they asked Madam Malikh to support their faction, so even if Young Lady Bhela gave them a copper Kobe koin then they could be considered lucky.

After the mood recovered, someone asked, “Elder Khasim, what are we supposed to do now?”

“I don’t know,” Elder Khasim shook his head. “You all should wait and see, don’t make ruckus and question the main family in the open!”

In the end, they all could only sigh as they couldn’t fathom Young Lady Bhela’s real intention.

This scene also happened on Elder Jhamil’s side. Reporting to Butler Tim, they both racked their brains trying to guess Bhela Malikh’s thoughts.

“Isn’t giving the position to your aunt is like taking from right hand to move it to the left one?” Butler Tim asked. “Is that enemy of yours already fallen out of her favor?”

“I don’t know yet, suppose that she really did want to limit Elder Khasim’s faction from getting too much power,” Elder Jhamil said, though he wasn’t too sure about his own words.

“You guys think too much,” a young woman with revealing garments said lazily as she painted her toe in the corner of the room. “That girl is like my Young Lady Lyla. Besides being lucky with her Unique Class, all she does is play with Young Lady Lyla all day. Could that kind of girl smart enough to play around politics with professionals like you?”

“You, what are you saying?” Butler Tim had begun to feel unhappy seeing this maidservant in his room. “Didn’t I say not to let Young Lady Lyla spend too much time with Bhela Malikh? Do you know because Young Lady Lyla opened her mouth, now Elder Jhamil’s people had a hard time reversing Bhela Malikh’s decision? Why were you letting her going outside in the first place?”

“She said she wanted to take a dump, so of course I had to let her go!” the maidservant snarled.

“And you believed her? That is literally the one and only excuse Young Lady Lyla used whenever she wanted to slip away!”

“Why are you blaming me now? Weren’t you the one who said you missed me?!”

Elder Jhamil took a step back. Trapped in the middle of lovers’ fight, truly felt like he was stuck in two hard places.

Fortunately, Butler Tim didn’t want to spend the day quarreling with this maid, and told Elder Jhamil to go bribing his aunt Granny Litha and try to protect his men's position in One Tulip Restaurant. Elder Jhamil felt the same. His family might not have contact with Granny Litha, but if he smoothen it up, wouldn’t it be easy to get One Tulip Restaurant back to his pocket?

This was also especially what Elder Khasim and his followers worried about. The main reason why Elder Jhamil got a hold of the family’s inner working in the first place was because he got too many privileges of being the manager of One Tulip Restaurant. The morale of Elder Khasim’s faction dwindled as they realized their Young Lady Bhela was missing after she brought Lyla out of the family hall this morning. Meanwhile, Elder Jhamil came to the kitchen to make a deal with Granny Litha before everyone else could influence the cranky old granny.

“You want me to preserve some of your friends positions?” Granny Litha asked Elder Jhamil with her hand didn’t stop <span style="text-decoration:underline;">nguleg</span> sambal.

“Yes, yes, we are family after all, Aunt Litha. I’ve got some problems to deal with thus I can’t manage One Tulip Restaurant for now, so Young Lady Bhela found you to supervise it in my stead!”

Granny Litha didn’t immediately answer. She glanced at this nephew of hers up and down.

“Back when I was your age, I kissed my elders’ hands before asking anything from them. What’s really wrong with this generation, where’s your manner?”

“Please, Aunt Litha, not now! You must’ve been tired working in the kitchen all these years, right? How about I make you a nice house in the inner family complex? I’ll build you a big one, how about it?”

Still occupied in grinding her sambal, Granny Litha stopped <span style="text-decoration:underline;">nguleg</span> and said, “Tell me your most trusted friends and their positions.”

Elder Jhamil prepared to lose more in this negotiation, but he didn’t expect it to be this easy!

Excited, he grabbed a stool and sat in front of Granny Litha, telling her the information she was gonna need if Granny Litha was to help him retain his influence inside One Tulip Restaurant.

The aunties and the maidservants quietly eavesdropped on their conversation. They’d never seen Elder Jhamil act like that in front of Granny Litha--usually, even though she was his blood relative aunt, Elder Jhamil never bothered to greet her, acting as if they were strangers, much less behave politely in front of Granny Litha. This made them feel complicated, as they’d thought Granny Litha was very much abandoned by her maiden family due her inability to attract a spouse. After all, even the lowest ranking maidservants treated Granny Litha like an air everytime she nagged with her “when I was your age” phrase. What really happened if Granny Litha asked Elder Jhamil to discipline these kitchen aunties and servants, then?

Granny Litha finally finished making sambal, scooped the red paste of chillies into a wooden bowl. Before she confirming she understood whatever Elder Jhamil plead her to, Granny Litha asked, “Are you sure Young Lady Bhela is the one who appointed me?”

All smiles, Elder Jhamil said, “Yes, Aunt Litha. Almost everyone was there when she said that.”

“Very well,” Granny Litha stood up. She then faced from the crowd of eavesdropping aunties, “Yaya, Umha, you two come here.”

Aunty Yaya and one aunty called Aunty Umha, who was dull and slow in her nature, stiffly trotted toward Granny Litha.

“Granny, you called?”

“Yaya,” Granny Litha said slowly, “you’re the most hateful and stupid person ever worked in this kitchen, you never even pretended listening to my words ever since you worked here. However, you cook very well.”

“Y-yes?” Aunty Yaya wasn’t sure Granny Litha was completing her or not.

Granny Litha looked at the other aunty. “Umha, you’re the most dull person instead. I agree with everyone here to keep you away from the cooking pot--boiled water is the most suited for you to make.”

This middle-aged aunty called Umha was dejected Granny Litha mentioned her shortcoming in front of everyone. Like Aunty Yaya, she wasn’t sure why Granny Litha even called her speciasifically.

“However,” Granny Litha continued, “I always noticed you always prepared uniformed chillies for me, and since you were tasked on picking fruits and vegetables I never once doubt you’re going to make a mistake like accidentally picking a rotting fruit. You’re slow, but always careful and very detailed. So you’ll be the accountant for One Tulip Restaurant from now on.”

_Claaank!_

A maidservant accidentally dropped a ceramic plate somewhere in the kitchen. But no eyes were even moving at her. Everyone was struck dumb by Granny Litha sudden appointment on making a dull aunty an accountant for the legendeary One Tulip Restaurant.

“Aunt Litha!!!” Elder Jhamil jumped from his stool with horror on his face, “y-you can’t! These servants can’t work in prestigious place like One Tulip Restaurant!”

Granny Litha ignored the freaked Elder Jhamil, then said to Aunty Yaya, “Yaya, you unlikable lass, help me cook in One Tulip Restaurant, I don’t like it but I suppose you’ll be the head chef from now on!”

“M-me…?” Aunty Yaya stammered as she pointed her face with trembling fingers.

“Yes, you. Do you want me to pick someone else?”

Aunty Yaya didn’t reply, as she wasn’t sure how to reply to that question.

Elder Jhamil, who realized this aunt of his was actually unreasonable like the young lady that appointed her as the manager of One Tulip Restaurant, now thought that he needed softer measures to make Granny Litha realize the error in her way.

“Aunt Litha, if you’re unreasonable like this, then even the main family wouldn’t be able to defend you if the elders council all banded together to take back your newly acquired position!”

Granny Litha didn’t want to bother with this nephew who never wanted to acknowledge her for years. The old woman brought her bamboo fan used to manage wood fire with her. Her eyes were sharp searchin as she walked around the kitchen. She recalled a face wasn’t too familiar in her mind, only she didn’t the other’s identity. Moments later, she stood in front of a sixteen years old young maidservant of the lowest ranking, whose job was no more than peeling fruits and cleaning vegetables.

“What’s your name?” Granny Litha asked.

“My name is Rara,” the maidservant replied, her eyes blinking confusedly.

“No Malikh surname?”

“No, my mother is a maidservant, and my father is a hunter from outside the family. My mother said it’s still five years more for me to get a Malikh surname if I don’t make trouble while working in the kitchen.”

“You don’t need to wait five years. Come with me to meet Grand Elder to get your Malikh surname.”

“Eeehh? Granny Litha?” unlike Aunty Yaya and Aunty Umha who were dumbfounded, the girl maidservant stood up and took a few steps back, her eyes shook.

“What? You afraid? I saw you carved some rabbit figures for Young Lady Lyla when you were on your break. You’ve got talents. So I want you as my chief decorator.”

Elder Jhamil grunted. The smile on his face swept away by his disgust. If the aunties who basically were servants bad enough, then appointing a young maidservant with no Malikh surname was akin to losing one’s mind. Elder Jhamil felt that One Tulip Restaurant would turn into ruin if Granny Litha just did whatever she wanted to do.

“Aunt Litha, my late grandfather wouldn’t be resting in peace if you messed up his One Tulip Restaurant! Please reconsider this!”

“His restaurant? Bah!” Granny Litha spat. “Even when he was alive, he wouldn’t dare to claim Matriarch’s One Tulip Restaurant as his own!”

Elder Jhamil was taken aback. It was then he realized he just uttered some words that, if said in front of those hateful fellows from Elder Khasim’s faction, would end his whole career for good.

“Yaya, Umha, and you lass, meet me in front of Grand Elder’s house. After we get Rara her surname, we’ll go to where One Tulip Restaurant is. There are loads of work waiting for you to do!”

Aunty Umha, who originally was the most timid aunty out of all them, asked stammeringly, “D-do we have to pay for the carriage cost ourselves?”

“Let’s go!” Aunty Yaya pulled Aunty Umha’s and also fetched the young maidservant Rara out of the kitchen. With Elder Jhamil’s face red with rage like that, she decided it was best to not linger around in the kitchen any longer.

For matter as big as One Tulip Restaurant, servants’ opinions like theirs weren’t important. Aunty Yaya prayed that both Young Lady Bhela and Granny Litha weren't just messing around with the whole arrangement. After all, if a petty man with Elder Jhamil’s caliber took his anger, then there was no hope for Aunty Yaya and the others to live decently in Malikh Family anymore.

---

Malikh Family had only one Grand Elder. This elder was an old man that had celebrated his one hundred years birthday a few years ago, with no particular ability of being the most respectable elder except for his seniority. Everyone called him Grand Elder Malikh, the last gatekeeper of Malikh’s policies, most respectable that even Ghalim Malikh would ask his opinion for big matters back when the Malikh Patriarch was in his prime. This Grand Elder akin to Granny Niu Elang of Elzhier Family and both Elder Fhantir and Elder Thula of Yashura Family in term of seniority and authority in their respective families.

Elder Jhamil, knowing he couldn’t talk sense to his aunt, quickly set off complaining to Grand Elder before Granny Litha could get the Malikh surname for the young maidservant called Rara. He reached the Grand Elder’s house before them, but unexpectedly Elder Jhamil met with Elder Khasim there.

“Grand Elder,” Elder Jhamil decided to ignore his political rival, proceeded to report instead, “as you might already know, Young Lady Bhela used her position as the eldest young lady of the main family to appoint my aunt Litha Malikh as the new manager of One Tulip Restaurant. Yet, due to her lack of exposure to the family’s ethics and education in her youth, she made an unreasonable turnover without putting too much thought into it. She plans to switch One Tulip Restaurant’s key positions with servants who worked in the kitchen!”

“Oh, she did?” Elder Khasim remarked as he poured warm tea for Grand Elder Malikh. Seeing that the fella Jhamil freaking out put a smile on his face. He smelled something foul, maybe if he dug deeper, he could get on something to pin Elder Jhamil down.

Elder Jhamil glared at him. Although he didn’t want to drop stone onto his foot, as a veteran politician, he knew the principle of taking control before the damage spread.

“Grand Elder, I know my aunt is old and a bit reasonable. I’m willing to take responsibility for her mistake if she happened to be ignorant of the common rules. But not only did she appoint servants, she also picked a young one of the lowest ranking that doesn’t have Malikh surname!”

The last sentence Elder Jhamil uttered frozen Elder Khasim’s smile. No wonder this snake Elder Jhamil admitting mistakes in front of his own enemy; turned out this fella wanted to use him to defend his own reputation.

Elder Khasim unwillingly said, “Now that I’ve heard Granny Litha did something that makes the legitimacy of One Tulip Restaurant be put under question, I can’t stay silent anymore. Grand Elder, I hope you can give warning to Granny Litha when she comes to seek your guide.”

Grand Elder Malikh was old and tired. Both the elders weren't sure whether he actually heard what they were saying with that sleepy expression he had. Slowly, Grand Elder picked his glass of tea, drank it, and put it back--but he didn’t say anything to reply to both of the elders.

“Grand Elder, what is it your say regarding this matter?” Elder Jhamil cautiously probed.

Again, Grand Elder said nothing. He only murmured some inaudible whispers to himself.

_Knock knock._

“Old fart, I’m coming in,” Granny Litha’s figure entered the house as soon as her voice resounded. Granny Litha sat in front of Grand Elder along with Elder Khasim and Elder Jhamil, she didn’t even ask permission as she brought three servants from the kitchen with her. From the way they looked, changing clothes they wore and carrying clothed bags with them, it obvious that she already decided to bring the three of them out of the village and nobody could make her decide otherwise.

“I need you to approve Malikh surname for this lass, old fart. My carriage is waiting outside. So quickly make it official, don’t waste anyone’s time!”

Elder Jhamil gasped in horror at Granny Litha impudence. Raising her voice in front of Grand Elder was bad enough. Calling her old fart was simply beyond words. The aunties and the maidservant behind her already pale beyond paper sheet--they now realized their future had been jeopardized by the time Granny Litha selected them. Even Elder Khasim, who originally enjoyed seeing Elder Jhamil stumbled by this unreasonable relative of his, had became speechless at Granny Litha’s cheekiness.

The Grand Elder Malikh himself, however, didn’t seem to have any opinion regarding her rude behavior. He wordlessly stood up and went on searching for his stamp.

“Now, lass, you want to join our proud Malikh Family? Come here,” he said while waving his hand.

The young maidservant Rara wasn’t this timid originally. Scary Granny Litha beside her, and two higher ups elders staring at her like hawks in front of her. Although it was her dream to get a better life for her family by getting officially recognized in the Malikh Family, the heavy atmosphere made her limbs feel like noodles. For the first time she felt she didn’t want to be a Malikh anymore.

“Why are you still hesitating lass?” Granny Litha impatiently slapped her thigh. “Back when I was your age, us little girls all had to face Elder Bhantul to get permission to go outside! This lazy old foggy is nowhere as scary as Elder Bhantul!”

Just as Elder Jhamil wanted to plead his aunt to shut her mouth for her own good, Grand Elder Malikh chuckled on the side.

“Elder Bhantul sure is scary. Matriarch Malikh promoted him out of the blue just so that she could make us naughty elders regret our mistakes,” Grand Elder muttered with nostalgic expression. Back when he first started his career as a young elder in the family elder council, he suffered a lot under Elder Bhantul’s oppression.

Eventually the young maidservant Rara became Rara Malikh only because the already crying maidservant couldn’t stand her ears being twisted by the impatient Granny Litha.

“Here you go, lass,” Grand Elder Malikh said after he stamped a fine white paper document. There were not many low-ranking servants proposed to the family to get surnames in Malikh Family, therefore Grand Elder Malikh never had the need to outsource his responsibility as the most senior elder to grant surnames. That didn’t mean Elder Khasim and Elder Jhamil didn’t know how the procedure was, however. They were baffled seeing how unusually accommodating Grand Elder Malikh was to this nameless servant. Grand Elder then said, “You are Rara Malikh from now on. Please always remember that your identity and action will reflect Malikh Family from this point onward. You’re one of us.”

“Th-thank you, Grand Elder,” Rara Malikh stammeredly replied.

The paper she received felt it was heftier than the giant cauldron she always tasked to set up whenever Ngajen Ceremony came. She never touched a white paper as fine as this, much less an official document.

Elder Khasim sighed, while Elder Jhamil’s face was sour. Now that Grand Elder had demonstrated that he didn’t have any intention to make One Tulip Restaurant’s transition harder, both the two elders knew the restaurant was Granny Litha’s for good.

“Litha,” Grand Elder Malikh muttered as Granny Litha about to lead the others walking out of the door.

“What is it again, old fart?”

Grand Elder looked at her with a hint of pensive look on his eyes.

“Neither Patriarch Ghalim or I had succeeded in convincing you to return to One Tulip Restaurant again. What is it that made you change your mind this time?”

“You’re asking me this? Why don’t you ask the fools beside you who almost gnawed Malikh Family inside out? I’m going to One Tulip Restaurant simply because the main family needed me to.”

“Mm, is that so?” Grand Elder nodded off his head, looking about to fall asleep. “I just thought nobody would change your mind unless Old Matriarch personally asks you to.”

Granny Litha didn’t like when others were being like this. She carried on leading the other aunties and newly made Rara Malikh out of Elder Ghalim’s house, who was sighing as the door being closed.

---

Although Yashura Family had gotten a part of their wall turned into debris because of reasons they didn’t want to talk about, something weird also happened on the other side of Badril Village. A cranky old woman was chosen as Malikh Family’s One Tulip Restaurant manager. People were laughing it off as a joke, saying that Malikh Family really too bored for them to promote an expired old maiden to manage their most prestigious restaurant.

But some, mostly organizers of Ngajen Ceremony, aunties and chefs, all sort of people who dealt with food, actually knew Granny Litha and the fact that she was the mind behind Malikh Family’s undeniably most delicious sambal known in recent decades. The news about this made others happy, especially the Elzhier Family. Now that those hateful Yashuras somehow managed to get their asses screwed by strange incidents and the most powerful sambal maker of Malikh Family was gone, Patriarch of Elzhier Family felt it was time for the Elzhiers to experience their long-awaited meteoric rise.

In the meantime, Granny Litha and others were loading their stuff onto the water buffalo carriage. Aunty Yaya and others were feeling lost. The three of the newly made restaurant higher ups, especially the young Rara Malikh, were overwhelmed by curious gazes of onlookers. Even after taking a deep breath, still they weren’t sure about their sudden promotion.

“Oh,” Aunty Yaya’s face brightened as she saw a familiar face amongst the onlookers, “isn’t that Jeng Kheles?”

The middle-aged woman Aunty Yaya referred to was a social butterfly servant of Elzhier Family, and she had a good relationship with Aunty Yaya. However, upon knowing that she was being noticed, the servant called Jeng Kheles turned her head and trotted away. She acted as if they didn’t know each other.

“You’ll get used to it,” the coarse voice of Granny Litha resounded behind her.

Aunty Yaya cast her gaze down. The cranky Granny Litha, the nervous Aunty Umha, and ex-maidservant Rara Malikh, who hugging her coarse travelling bag, looking almost at her limit of having a mental breakdown--couldn’t she see some sweeter faces other than these unpleasant folks before they set off for One Tulip Restaurant?

“Yuuhuuu~~~ hellow there Malikh aunties!”

Lyla Blackwood and Bhela Malikh came unexpectedly. Aunty Yaya was surprised. They heard the Blackwood Family escorts were looking for this Young Lady Lyla everywhere, but here she was, tip-toeing around with a big bamboo basket she hugged close to her chest. Wearing dull-looking clothes that had its color faded, coupled with her bun-styled hair, she looked no different than any other Badril Village girls on the street. No wonder people sent by Butler Tim of Blackwood Family couldn’t locate their carefree young lady.

“Ah, Young Lady Lyla, what are you doing here?!” Aunty Yaya asked with her voice suppressed.

“We’re going to rice paddies! We’re going to gather rice field conch!” Lyla replied with eyes full of anticipation. She continued, “I’m going to fill this basket with delicious rice field conch, and Sis Bhela would skewer them into spicey satays for lunch!”

“What? How could a noble young lady like you jump into mud to gather dirty rice field conches?” Aunty Yaya had a headache looking at these two troublesome young ladies before her. “More importantly, Young Lady Bhela, why would you bring your bow if you were only going to go to rice paddies?”

Bhela, contrast to Lyla who carried a large basket to gather conch, had her shortbow and quiver full of arrows with her. “After rice field, we’re going to mountain,” Bhela replied.

“We’re going to hunt wild goats!” Lyla exclaimed. “And Sis Bhela would skewer them into peanut sauce satays for lunch!” Sneakily, she wiped her droll that unfortunately leaked after she mentioned delicious satays a few times. Clearly Lyla was looking forward to her lunch this afternoon.

“Young Lady Bhela,” Aunty Yaya asked with a pleading tone, “don’t you know Blackwood Family is looking for Young Lady Lyla?”

“Yes, I know. That’s why we’re crashing in Elzhier Family now,” Bhela replied.

“Hihi, people here don’t recognize my face. They won’t find me if I bun my hair this way,” Lyla giggled, referring to her hair bun style that was popular only in commoners circle. She didn’t realize, though, even if she didn’t bother disguised herself with different hair style, nobody would recognize a girl with bamboo basket in her hands as a noble young lady if she kept yelling about gathering conch on rice paddies every few minutes or so.

Aunty Yaya groaned as she didn’t know how to handle the naughty Lyla and the stoic Bhela, when the family had its political disturbance, were looking forward to playing around to their heart’s content.

Granny Litha came with a walking stick she always had with her whenever she went outside Malikh Family’s area. “You two ran away just so that you can make satays outdoor? Back when I was your age, girls were all very obedient staying at home learning how to weave our own dress and make sambals all day! Only smelly boys get dirty gathering ride field conches and hunting for wild goats!”

Lyla, however, who never had the experience of living as a real local girl, disagreed. “What?! Why would I share my satays with smelly boys? That would never happen!”

“Hmph! You city girl, how entitled!”

Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair and said, “Lyla, isn’t there something you want to ask Granny Litha?”

“So, you want to ask me something?” Granny Litha looked at the bamboo basket holding girl.

“Yes,” Lyla said, her face became serious as she asked, “How exactly grass taste like?”

“No, that wasn’t what you want to ask Granny Litha, wasn’t it?” Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair harder. She then asked it instead on the naughty’s girl behalf. “We want to know whether it’s okay to visit One Tulip Restaurant this evening.”

“Why do you need my permission for this? Aren’t you two naughty lasses the one who made this old granny has to venture outside the village to deal with the mess that incompetent folks left behind?”

Lyla blinked her eyes, didn’t know what Granny Litha was talking about.

On the other hand, Bhela continued patting Lyla’s head, pretending she didn’t know what Granny Litha was talking about.

“Hmph!” Granny Litha snorted. She crankily scolded them again, “You think your parents would let you girls travelling around after dark without family’s supervision?”

“Don’t worry, Granny Litha,” Bhela said, “someone I know in Elzhier Family said Elder Sheyla had some business to attend in the same city tonight. So I merely asked for a ride and they let us come with them.”

Some folks in Badril Village still superstitious and looked down on girls who liked to go out at night. But Bhela didn’t care. Lyla wanted to visit One Tulip Restaurant after knowing delicious food there. Therefore, as the Young Lady of Bhela Malikh, she had to accommodate this glutton to taste Malikh Family’s most prized dishes at their fullest potential, as this might be their last chance to play to their heart’s content before Butler Tim really did restrict Lyla’s movement.

And with that, Bhela and Lyla let the aunties and Granny Litha enter the carriage, setting them off on the mouth of Badril Village.

“Don’t forget to prepare me beef satays tonight for freeeee~~” Lyla yelled as she waved her hand. The water-buffalo carriage Granny Litha and others were slowly drifted away from Badril Village, yet, the girl still happily waving her hand while yelling a bunch of food that she wanted to eat.

Granny Litha snorted. “That lass comes from a rich noble family, yet she still dares to ask this old woman beef satay for free?”

Such an air headed girl! Granny Litha had lived for more than eighty years, yet never she met a girl like Lyla Blackwood!

The old woman couldn’t take her eyes off the girls. Bhela seemed to be saying something to Lyla, ruffling her head out of habit. This young lady of fifteen’s face was too far away for Granny Litha to notice her expression--yet, somehow, she could see the vivid image of a stoic girl pampering her friend like she was her own sister.

“Back when I was their age--”

Back when Granny Litha was at their age, she never had the impudence to mess around like them. She was always fond of her study and practicing her craft to be a disciple worthy of Matriarch Malikh. And she always felt content with her life. Once a while, whenever she did a good job, a beautiful woman would ruffle her hair. This beautiful woman almost had never smiled nor she ever gave people praise, a coldness and stoic that fit with her icy beauty, giving chill those who didn’t know her well--yet, in reality, very warm to those who close with her.

Remembering her beauty made Granny Litha thinking about that young lady of hers who made her travel outside the village to manage One Tulip Restaurant that she already gave up decades ago.

“But I thought you’ll never care about One Tulip Restaurant again unless Matriarch Malikh personally comes to ask you to.”

Grand Elder Malikh said that.

A soft sigh escaped Granny Litha’s dry lips. She shook her head and tried to watch scenery as the carriage slowly traversed the grassy road ahead.

“I will return, Litha. In the meantime, please continue making sambal and prove yourself worthy in inheriting my One Tulip Restaurant.”

Under a stormy night sometimes in the past, the beautiful woman pulled her hood again after she said her farewell. Litha Malikh was one of the people she visited before she went following a man’s step, just a night before the news of Matriarch Malikh’s sudden retirement and the rumor of her eloping with an unknown man made a big wave in Badril Village. Even after all these seventy years, Granny Litha would never forget that beautiful face whose iciness hid a very warm soul that she always looked up to.

Sighing once again, Granny Litha accidentally uttered her train of thought, “Young Lady Bhela is fifteen this year, isn’t she?”

“Huh?” Aunty Yaya who sat beside her woke up from her nap. “She is.”

“She looks quite like Matriarch Malikh when she was young,” Granny Litha said.

“Is she?”

Not only their beauty was the same, even their temperament, preference of doing things, and their boldness to disregard the old custom--all the resemblance between them were strikingly uncanny. If only not for Bhela’s short bob hair cut and her youthfulness, Granny Litha really thought Matriarch Malikh really did return to Malikh Family after all these seventy long years.
