The Yashura was a normal family in Badril Village, Norman’s investigations concluded to this. Yet the pair of Yurrin cousins believed Yashura was anything but normal, simply because Mama Ross said so.

On break from the meeting, Merly took an excuse to stroll to Yashura Family’s backyard. The girl declined Patriarch Shuro’s offer to get a maidservant to accompany her, saying she could just ask directions to whoever she met when needed. She wasn’t alone, however, Mama Ross was inside her. Because of the awkward mood from earlier, Patriarch Shuro and his family readily agreed, unaware that Mama Ross took the chance to investigate Yashura Family from inside out.

“The ancient defensive formation’s heart should be around here,” Mama Ross whispered inside Merly’s mind. No one was around when they just arrived in Yashura Family’s garden.

“Are you sure they have that kind of formation, Mama Ross?” Merly asked hesitantly, “they don’t seem the sophisticated kind.”

“The current generation may be simple, but their origin is not,” Mama Ross explained. “The fact that no experts guarding the family means their history is thinning out. Maybe the only real expert that living the standard of ancient Yashura is that Jhuro child Norman talked before.”

“The kid’s father…” Merly mumbled.

“Patriarch Shuro’s still in his prime age, there’s still a chance for him to get an heir from his own blood. Yet, even though his talent is hopeless, Shira Yashura’s position as the next patriarch is very stable. No matter how carefree a Mossack-descent family is, they'll think twice before making a boy with foul rumors surrounding him an heir. It must be his father’s influence that did the work. We should get Jhuro Yashura investigated to decide whether or not Yashura Family should be befriended.”

“Yes.”

From the report Norman had concluded the golden era of Yashura Family was the previous generation; they were known as the great guardians of Badril Village. If this was a few years earlier then Mama Ross would tell Sir Baront to take the chances and make connection with Yashura Family. It was just they still couldn’t be sure whether this family could stand up to their former glory with that kind of patriarch and elders ruling the current generation.

They continued to stroll. Eventually, what welcomed them was a lion statue.

Cracks were apparent on its moldy surface. And the fierce roar the lion bragged suggested its unwillingness being defeated by the flow of time. Mama Ross couldn’t tell the exact year the statue was built, but the knowledge of an exhausting study about ancient Formations during her time helped her to guess the lion statue’s age. The venerable Nalaq found the lingering mana injected into the statue was around one hundred years old.

“So, even at least from the two previous generations, the Yashura Family is already a powerhouse,” Mama Ross concluded after determining the age of the ancient formation before her. If that was the case this family’s roots ought to be solid.

Appearing out from Merly’s body, Mama Ross continued to study the lion statue with her brows knitted.

“Quite unexpected. There are at least seven different minor supportive formations installed after the main defensive Formation!”

Merly didn’t know about Art of Formation that much. But she could feel Mama Ross’s faint gasp of surprise, she instantly knew this finding was a big deal. “Is that very good, Mama Ross?”

“At least today we know Yashura Family had a Formation genius two to three generations ago,” Mama Ross said solemnly. If Yurrin Family could get a peek at this Formation genius’s legacy, Mama Ross wouldn’t be so worried about the two Yurrin children whom she already took under her wings. “The mana applied is almost one hundred years old. But I suspect this statue way older than that; look here, Merly, the mana cast on the statue is seeped deep into the stone. One method to prolong a Formation’s lifespan is to cast it on an ancient object. And the mana applied seems to be layered--the lower layered already exhausted and left unmaintained. The one who made it has used the statue for something else before it became the heart of defensive Formation.”

Merly asked, “Mama Ross means they have another secret like this? I heard there’s a well-respected bank with the name Yashura World Bank in the west of Tiramikal Continent. Is this family connected to them in some way?”

“I haven’t had the chance to study recent history since my revival, my dear. There’s a possibility the Yashura branched out in the past and made themselves rooted in different places, but it’s not our concern for now,” Mama Ross waved her hand gently. “Try using your magic item to identify the mystery behind this Formation. Learning one or two about ancient spells is very beneficial for your current progress, dear.”

Ever since she made the contract with Mama Ross, Merly never once hesitated doing whatever the lady Nalaq asked her to do. This time was no different. The Yurrin girl immediately took out a wristband from her **Mystic Bag**, the kind that gleamed an eerie light upon being injected with a little bit of mana. The wristband was a magic item, specialized in casting support skills related to Specialist Class, of which usually used to gather information from an object or person by reading the subtle data from their flow of mana.

Just when Merly began activating the wristband…

“This Young Lady Yurrin, this statue is too dirty. It’s too humble for a young lady to play with. Please allow this old servant to clean it first for you.”

Not only Merly, even Mama Ross was started by the sudden voice intruding from behind. They whirled their body around, found an old butler smiled a serene smile. It was Yulong.

Startled a few steps back both at the same time, Mama Ross and Merly had their tongue tied as they watched Yulong approach the old lion statue. The pair couldn’t take their eyes off from the old butler, and they couldn’t say anything either.

The lady Nalaq was indignant knowing someone dared to sneak from her behind. There was no way an experienced Mage like Mama Ross, although long ceased to live, to be unaware of someone standing behind unless the other party intentionally suppressed their presence--Mama Ross would suffer a thousand deaths if she was that sloppy back in her time. Haplessly, they witnessed without protest as Yulong, still keeping his professional butler poise, unhurriedly brushed the moss off from the statue’s surface.

Knowing that the guest awkwardly stared at him, Yulong turned toward the dumbfounded Merly and said politely, “It might take a while to clean this statue, Young Lady Yurrin. Perhaps, the flower garden in the west wing suits you best rather than this old uncared place.”

He paused, then deliberately said, “You should be more careful next time when visiting unknown places.”

Now it was Merly’s turn to get angry at the kind-looking old butler. Mama Ross too harrumphed as if she knew Yulong could see her despite not making herself visible to ordinary eyes. Though his words were polite, it was clear he intended to get rid of them. Mama Ross told Merly to go back and not make trouble in front of this seemingly powerless butler who didn’t have any level and class.

“That butler is trouble,” Mama Ross whispered when they were already far away. “I can’t see any mana inside him. Any living being should have at least a trace of mana, even if they never use it their entire life.”

The more they learned about Yashura Family, the more strange it seemed to them.

Patriarch Shuro Yashura and his daughter Mila were accompanying the male guests on the courtyard, chatting while standing in a circle with hands holding glasses of tuaq. Patriarch Shuro wouldn’t share tuaq carelessly with strangers but, since they already messed up, he thought it didn’t matter opening up a few bottles of tuaq that were considered antiques in the family.

Merly and Mama Ross came back, and they wanted Jerrin and Norman to join them and stroll the spacious Yashura Family’s place. Both the men who were called understood that something had happened from seeing the concerned look on Merly’s face.

“Strange? The old butler?” Jerrin rubbed his chin hearing Merly’s concern--Mama Ross, who hadn’t come out from her body to preserve mana, let the girl do the talking the moment they pulled Jerrin and Norman to a safe place away from prying eyes. Jerrin then hummed again as he thought of something, saying, “A butler who looks like coming from a noble family but working here instead is already strange. And from his name this butler doesn’t sound like coming from the west, either. Butlers working for western aristocrats would at least have common surnames”

“No, not that kind of strange,” Merly shook her head. “Mama Ross feels no presence of mana coming out from that butler.”

“What?” Jerrin knitted his brows, he worked on Blue Robe Society’s External Relations Department for two years and had been aware ugly cases where bad people hide their real power and covered their identity, “surely we’re not dealing with a wanted criminal, are we?”

Norman witnessed Merly’s strange behaviour back when Yulong greeted them at the gate. For the lady Nalaq to be vigilant against the harmless-looking old butler was already within expectations. “Young Lady Merly, is there anything this servant can help you with?”

“Mama Ross said uncovering the background of the butler named Yulong and Shira Yashura’s father, Jhuro Yashura, is a priority for us to make a decision regarding Yashura Family,” Merly slowly said, then she delivered the words Mama Ross said within her mind to the coachman, “Norman, how much do you know about these two people?”

“If this about Sir Jhuro Yashura, I happen to know a bit and heard some rumors, I can write another report about him in detail,” Norman took a beat, seemed to be hesitating, “but for the old butler… apart from the fact he hails from Young Master Shira’s mother’s entourage fifteen years ago, there’s no other peculiar information about him.”

Butler Yulong’s record was clean and straight, always keeping his job in order and never made mistakes. Apparently, Patriarch Shuro liked him greatly, giving him many responsibilities of the inner Yashura Family matters even though the Mossack people hadn’t had any experiences hiring western-style butlers.

“Mm.” Merly hummed, closing her eyes. Jerrin and Norman waited for her as they knew the girl was communicating with the lady Nalaq inside her body. A moment later, she opened her eyes, declaring Mama Ross’s intention as if she was a revered envoy, “Norman, you uncover Butler Yulong’s past before we leave the village.”

“Understood, Young Lady Merly.”

Investigating a person with a clean background wasn't an easy thing to do. However, since Mama Ross gave the order herself, then Norman had no choice other than to succeed. His real masters were Merly’s and Jerrin’s fathers, thus he’d do anything in his reach so that the two little masters of his kept receiving the lady Nalaq’s favor.

“Merly, do we need to consult this with Teacher Barront?” Jerrin asked.

Merly shook her head. For this matter, she didn’t need to ask Mama Ross, since the Nalaq already said before pulling Jerrin and Norman that they needed someone to entertain the host. It was no good for the guests to mind their own business if the host was being polite with them. After all, the Yurrins might need to befriend this Yashura Family if the investigations turned out to be good.

“Teacher Baront is the one who can humor Patriarch Yashura. So we don’t need to bother him. Let’s just focus on the butler and the kid’s father,” Merly said. She had made herself comfortable with calling the shot since the others respected Mama Ross inside of her. After that Merly told both the men what Mama Ross and her discovered in Yashura Family’s old garden. Jerrin Yurrin’s eyes shone upon hearing the mysterious ancient Formation and the prospect of old Formation genius’s legacy.

Even though they didn’t get the third disciple Sir Baront wanted, Jerrin and Merly hastily travelled to Badril Village wasn’t a wasted matter indeed.

They walked back to regroup with their teacher. As soon as they saw the Patriarch Shuro and his daughter Mila, Jerrin with a big smile congratulating the other party, “Patriarch Yashura, I heard your family is a hidden master in the art of Formation. Why don’t we discuss it sometimes?”

“Haha! What hidden master, Young Master Jerrin, you’re overestimating us common village folks! Formation is a thing that old Yashuras dabbled in our spare times!” Patriarch Shuro humbly dismissed the remark with a hearty laugh. He then sneakily coughed, leaning to his daughter Mila and whispered, “Girl, what’s this _Formation_ thingy he’s talking about?”

“The fuck would I know?!” Mila whispered back impatiently. “Do I look like a geek like that kid Shira?”

Patriarch Shuro pretended he didn’t hear what Mila said and continued laughing. He said to Jerrin, “Young Master Jerrin, you just need to find my nephew Shira if you have something complicated to discuss, he’s the smartest of us villagers!”

Shira was the only one in Yashura Family who actually read non-fiction books. The simple-minded pair father and daughter always threw the hot ball to him whenever this kind of problem arose. Jerrin and others good-naturedly nodded as they pretended they didn’t hear their whispering exchanges. The pair of father's and daughter’s faces were indeed as thick as Yashura Family’s legendary sturdy wall.

Speaking of Shira, he came back after he said he was going to bring the rogue Nalaq with him. He returned alone.

“Shira my boy, what’s taking you so long?” Patriarch Shuro asked.

Shira replied, “The Nalaq wanted to meet Esteemed Madame Ross in a secluded shed. I needed a while preparing them.”

“What for?”

Shira shrugged. “Don’t know. Didn’t ask.” More accurately, he didn’t _want to_ ask.

“It doesn’t matter,” Merly waved her hand. “Against a low-level rogue Nalaq, a warning from Mama Ross is sufficient to make them run between their tails. It doesn’t matter if they’re preparing a trap or not.”

So the other party thought Good-Natured Spirit was setting a trap. That’s good, it was better for Shira if they misunderstood. That way, he didn’t need to explain the matter about the shady candle-lit room, out-of-place bed of roses, and a certain Good-For-Nothing Spirit with a guitar waiting.

Merly then ordered Shira to lead her to the shed where the two Nalaqs were supposed to meet. The boy sighed, didn’t know whether the girl or the Nalaq inside her was the one who was rude to him this time. But it didn’t matter, in the end, even that cocky Good-Natured Spirit didn’t worth a penny on the esteemed guests’ eyes. He felt bad thinking Good-Natured Spirit would get rejected and would get rid of. He still felt bad about his primary source of income that would probably soon disappear.

Shira sighed again.

“Stop sighing,” Merly barked as she followed behind the boy.

“Shouldn’t we bring more people?” Shira asked wryly.

“I don’t know you are this cowardly. Let’s not waste anyone’s time,” Merly said, knitting her brows.

This was the girl he was talking with, not the Nalaq, Shira realized. He wanted to say this had nothing to do with cowardice or what not but he decided to say nothing.

“That is the place where the Nalaq is waiting,” Shira said as he pointed out a nice little shed that seemed ordinary. Then he coughed, saying, “Be careful… he might prepare something… unexpected.”

Mama Ross came out from Merly’s body. Looking at the awkward Shira, she waved her hand, saying, “Thank you for your concern, child. A Nalaq’s threat might scare you since you’ve been living all your life in a small village like this. However, I’m already getting used to a life in the great war; setting a little trap is futile against me.”

And they mentioned about traps again, this made Shira feel more awkward about it all. Thus with his eyes blinking, Shira clasped his wrist, tried very hard to look innocent and pretending to know nothing about the near future trouble that he worried might happen.

“Nothing will happen. If that rogue Nalaq is smart, he’d be obediently move away after we talk like two civilized Nalaqs,” Mama Ross said confidently.

Shira nodded with a smile that became even more wry than the smile he had previously. It was because he thought Good-Natured Spirit was a moron that he worried greatly.

“Merly, wait here with this Yashura child. Giving a warning to this rogue Nalaq should take around five minutes, I’ll be quick,” Mama Ross said as she ruffled Merly’s hair.

“Yes, Mama Ross.”

Then Mama Ross floated away toward the secluded shed’s direction. Soon, her transparent figure seeped into the wooden plank door. Nobody except her and Good-Natured Spirit was inside.

_JREEENGG!!!_

A crisp noise of a guitar being strummed from inside was heard immediately after Mama Ross entered. It transitioned seamlessly into an energizing, unapologetic Spanish guitar melody.

_Jreng jeeng jreng jeng jreeng..._

No angry arguments could be heard from inside, quiet except for Good-Natured Spirit trying to hit on Mama Ross with his corny romantic guitar melody. It was peaceful unlike what Shira worried beforehand. However, just when Shira was about to pat his chest in relief, the shed suddenly exploded.

_BBOOOOOOOMMMM!!!_

---

It wasn’t that long since a loud explosion came from Yashura Family, the explosion made the village shake yet again. The Village Head, who was in Elzhier Family doing a trivial daily paper job, was taken back by the sudden explosion.

He turned his head in surprise. “Again? What happened in Yashura Family?!”

Even in Malikh Family, the forever carefree Lyla Blackwood who previously was busy coaxing the proud bunny with carrots, swiftly sprang back to Bhela at the thundering sound of explosion.

“What was that Sistah?! What was that!!!” Lyla cried as she leaped into Bhela’s embrace.

Bhela’s face was solemn as she tried to guess what had happened. Then, looking at Lyla’s scaredy eyes, she said slowly, “Someone who made a contract with evil is being punished by karma. You should remember this to not follow their foolish step, Lyla.”

Lyla, who had her mind half-occupied with the now fleeing bunny, nodded her head even though she didn’t fully understand. Bhela brought the noble girl in as to not minding about the explosion that had nothing to do with Malikh Family.

Back to Yashura Family, the secluded meeting place where now bushes and trees were being swallowed by raging flames. Choked by thick smokes, Shira lifted his head from kissing dirt--near him, Merly Yurrin stared at the burning shed dazedly with a glint of righteous fury seen on her eyes.

Shira followed the girl’s gaze toward the source of the madness, yet could see nothing but raging fire. In the center of it, Good-Natured Spirit’s voice could be heard: “Whoa, whoa there, big boobs lady, let’s try to talk this out in a civilized manner, okay…”

Suddenly, the licking flames that arose with the tall of adult males began to get sucked in single direction, unfolding the two ethereal silhouettes in the midst of it all: a suave, hairy chest revealing Good-Natured Spirit hugging a guitar with a stalk of red rose he bit between his teeth, and a fireball channeling Mama Ross, who was indulged in unreasonable madness and tried her best to show her intent to kill the other Nalaq just with her glare.

_BOOOOMMM!!!_

The fireball exploded even more shocking than the one from before. When Shira lifted his head again this time, not only the shed ruined by the swallowing fire, the sturdy wall that had been the pride of Yashura Family for a hundred years, that been said could defend against one thousand type of monsters, had its most sturdy part blasted by the blind fireball Mama Ross thrown.

_BOOOOOOOMMMM!!!_

Shira couldn’t help but to suck a deep breath. It could only be described as madness happening all around him. The most shocking of all of this was, even though Mama Ross attacked him with tremendous destructive power, Good-Natured Spirit dodgedly disappeared for a brief moment then suddenly popped out beside the tongue-tied Mama Ross, unschated.

“Beautiful lady, being fierce is okay, but too much of it you’ll ruin your beauty. Let’s calm down and talk about peace and love, how ‘bout it?” his husky whisper rang beside Mama Ross’s ear, while sneakily, his hand had been groping her butt.

Mama Ross’s pupil shrank. She had long been dead, and had long forgotten how fast and deadly this guy’s movement could be.

“Hufff!” exploding the mana she reserved these past three years, Mama Ross engulfed her spiritual being with living flame, she immediately broke free from Good-Natured Spirit’s blatant sexual assault, and while doing so, made a whip with her fire elemental mana and flashed it onto Good-Natured Spirit’s face.

The woman who used to be one of the pillars that supervised Tiramikal Continent was by no means weak. Even when she revived as a Nalaq, and she could only manifest one-fourth of her past power with the help of the contract she made with Merly Yurrin, the whip she created with the intent of blasting the shameless rogue Nalaq’s face only leave a shallow whipping mark. Good-Natured Spirit even smirked as he rubbed his whipped face.

Hissing, Good-Natured Spirit remarked, “So feisty!”

Fire in Mama Ross’s eyes shimmered no longer--instead, bursting out along with her abundance of enmity. The magical flame that gulfing her body began to seep inside, coloring her entire ethereal body with the color of fiery embers.

“Mama Ross!” Merly cried, trying to call her name and make her return to her normal calm Mama Ross. The inexperienced Merly was at loss; the position of the contractor of Mama Ross made it known that the lady Nalaq was planning to burn herself along with the evil, vulgar Nalaq with the guitar.

“What to do? I just touched you a little, beautiful big boobs lady, no need to get serious!” Even Good-Natured Spirit couldn’t help but complain to seek justice--which very much he didn’t deserve.

The flaming Mama Ross arose into the air. Like a rising sun she shone her fire elemental affinity mana like the ancient idol in stories.

Shira was thunderstruck. It seemed Mama Ross was going to release an awesome fire skill that would blast Good-For-Nothing Spirit for good. However… had the mad lady Nalaq consider him and Merly Yurrin also was inside her firing range?

Not far from where Shira was crouching from danger, he saw Merly kneeling with her head lowered, expression serene, seemingly to beg for miracle yet accepting whatever calamity that would descend upon her at the same time.

“Fool!” although Shira didn’t like the girl, as a boy whose head drilled with Mossack customs as he was, absolutely wouldn’t let a guest die in his own yard.

Therefore, moving his untalented body as a Novice, Shira sprang from his hiding position, grabbing the Young Lady Yurrin by the hip, and started to escape to a cover.

“Release me, you little swine!” Merly screamed, “I need to channel my mana for Mama Ross!”

So the reason for the lady Nalaq could cast a spell this powerful was because this girl provided her with raw mana. Shira’s expression darkened. Although he had the slightest virtue of ancient Mossack to respect and protect one’s guests, he wasn’t a fool himself who would be washing his own neck while the other person sharpened their executing blade.

Shira quickly concluded the situation. They said human channeled mana through breathing technique as their basic function to connect their manasphere inside toward the ever empowering law of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">System</span> outside. Then he pinched Merly’s nose and covered her mouth. His survival depended on whether he let Merly breathe properly or not.

“Sffhwine! Shhffwiiine!”

Indeed that worked. Mama Ross felt the mana being supplied to her halted, and abruptly her sharp gaze moved to the restrained Merly.

“Release Merly immediately!”

Shira staggered, the fiery aura Mama Ross radiated intimidated him. But with Yashura Family’s safety behind him, he forced himself to hold his ground.

“You’re going to destroy Yashura Family, Esteemed Lady Nalaq, please quell your anger!” Shira begged.

“Impudent! Who told you to talk back to me! Release her--you’re courting your death if you don’t release her!”

Shira’s sucked a deep breath. He just did what he did because he thought that Mama Ross lost her mind in a momentary lapse of reason, all due to Good-Natured Spirit’s assault. Yet the more he saw, the clearer it was to him that he was wrong. The lady Nalaq had her mind in order, and the anger and the killing intent directed toward the boy were real.

For a split second Shira glanced at Good-Natured Spirit, the one who started it all, but it was useless. The bastard was rubbing his chin as his head tilted sneakily to get a better view on Mama Ross’s butt; it wasn’t clear whether he realized--or even cared--about the impending doom that would soon befall them.

Seeing that talking to both the Nalaqs was useless, Shira then whispered beside Merly’s ear. “Please do me a favor. Lady Nalaq can burn the bastard all she wants, just not here in Yashura Family.”

There was no response coming from Merly. All Shira could hear was her heavy breathing, breathing through her mouth, the breath that escaping from between his fingers.

“Please, talk to Lady Nalaq,” Shira said again, begging.

Merly was stiff like a statue. Shira had no choice but to release her, since he had no more reliable options. Yet although he didn’t have too much hope relying on the girl, never did he expect that Merly would turn on him, with her eyes drowning in fury, pointing her finger with immediate judgement.

“Swine! How dare you touch me! Who do you think you are?!” Merly’s scream squealing sharply. Turning to Mama Ross, she complained, “Mama Ross, please give me justice!”

“Good!” the flaming Mama Ross curtly exclaimed, glaring at Shira and Good-Natured Spirit back and forth. “No wonder such a hateful man found himself a home here. Turns out they’re both wearing the same disgusting wolf skin--good!”

Shira’s eyes turned cold. He didn’t need to work his brain to realize the lady Nalaq intended to burn the defenseless him before she dealt with Good-Natured Spirit.

“You’re a guest of Yashura Family, are you sure you want to harm your host?” the boy warned icily.

Mama Ross scoffed. She began to conjure a fireball--but enough to burn the cocky boy to half-death state.

Good-Natured Spirit, who was interrupted, “Ay, big boobs lady, I know that little shit could be annoying, but I wouldn’t throw that dangerous fireball at him if I were you.”

“Shut up! You’re the next one who’s gonna die, Gyl!”

Good-Natured Spirit laughed. He, a suave spirit who had been here for around a year, would plan it through step by step before even plucking a strand of the boy’s hair. This lady Nalaq didn’t listen to reason. Sure enough, she was a bimbo. “Harming someone behind Yashura Family’s wall is hefta complicated matter than you’d think,” he warned again.

Mama Ross didn’t care. Lecherous men were the ones she hated the most. Fueled by Good-Natured Spirit’s words, the fireball she channeled got bigger than it already was.

_SWUOOOOSSSHH!!_

Before even Mama Ross could throw her fireball, though, four pouncing metal snakes sprang from her blind spots, coiling around her transparent body. Four masked silhouettes leaped out of their hiding place, pushing the stunned Mama Ross’s face onto the ground. All happened too fast. Merly, in the midst of freaking out, only to return to reality at the scene of Mama Ross being restrained in chains by four masked women in black--and very tight--clad. Only two seconds passed, Merly herself got pushed down from behind.

Shira, with his eyes alert, shot a glance as he prepared someone to attack him like both Mama Ross and Merly were. Yet the masked women didn’t bother with him. The boy wasn’t sure whether this mysterious group lacked personals or simply didn’t see him as a threat. He wasn’t expecting them at all.

On the contrary, though Good-Natured Spirit expected someone else to come down instead, was too happy to see those voluptuous curves again. Some of them had even bigger melons than Mama Ross. He even whistled happily at the scene of Mama Ross wrestling body-to-body with the voluptuous masked ladies on the ground.

This made Shira tightening his brows. Weren’t these women from the hidden Big-Boobs Sect Good-Natured Spirit mentioned once?

As they said, seeing is believing. Seeing that Good-Natured Spirit was smug and happy there was no reason for Shira doubting him now.

“Release me! We did our stand against their sexual assault! Release Mama Ross!” Merly screamed. Even then, the masked women didn’t budge. They kept pinning them down the ground.

_Splaash!_

The sound of splashing water came as staggering as a thunderous strike. Just when the esteemed Nalaq Mama Ross being pushed down pitifully, the old butler, Yulong, unconcernedly appeared towards the fire with a bucket of water.

_Splash! Splaaash!_

“Yulong!” Shira ran toward the butler, and urgently whispered, “go tell my uncle, anonymous members of a hidden sect came into our walls!”

Yulong, gazing at his young master blankly, asked, “What hidden sect, young master? I don’t know what you are talking about.”

“Don’t you see how they pin down Madame Nalaq?” Shira hissed.

Yulong followed the direction Shira signaled with his eyes. The masked women awkwardly waiting for the old butler took his eyes off them. A moment later, the butler’s eyes came back to the boy again. His wrinkled face smiled with worry. “Young Master Shira, I don’t see anyone there.”

“Yulong, you’re joking,” Shira said wryly. Yulong was always a solemn man and never did Shira see him make a joke--especially not in this kind of situation. “They burned down the damned place, Yulong…. All started because Madame Ross confronted that guy.”

“What guy?” Yulong again followed the direction Shira signalled, but now with a pair of alertful eyes. The Nalaq with the Spanish guitar brazenly returned back the butler’s gaze, scoffing. Yulong’s gaze turned cold.

But then Yulong said to Shira again, “I don’t see anything, Young Master.”

“Yulong…”

“Young master, I really don’t see anything,” Yulong said with an assuring smile. Then his eyes wandered at the uninvited guests, his gaze was cold, repeating slowly, “I said… I really don’t see anything here.”

Good-Natured Spirit laughed at the blatant threat. But on the other side the eyes of the masked women flickered, exchanged glances with each other, and then quickly came to a decision. They disappeared like a wind blowing puffs of smoke, bringing the crying and screaming Merly and Mama Ross--whose eyes seemed to be lost--with them.

Now that the eye-candies were gone, Good-Natured Spirit laughed sarcastically at the old butler as he playfully played his guitar. “I didn’t see anything, I didn’t do anything.” And with that, he flew away like nothing had happened.

All of the sudden, the burning place turned quiet.

“See, there’s nothing there,” Yulong turned to his young master, nodding his head as if he was satisfied with something.

Not long after that, a panic stricken crowd came trotting urgently with buckets of water on their hands. Leading them was Patriarch Shuro, who upon seeing the large fire and the hole in the family’s wall with his own eyes, became dizzy and almost fainted on the spot. It was fortunate Mila was there with a few of idle young wives she knew, and few of them apparently knew had an affinity with water elemental and could provide some help in extinguishing the fire.

“Shira Shira Shira! What the fuck happening here??!!!!” Mila asked calmly.

Before Shira could decide whether to tell the truth or not, Butler Yulong came forward and begged for forgiveness. “Apologize, Young Lady Mila, this servant burned some trash here and unwittingly set ablaze the whole place. It’s all my fault.” he admitted regretfully. After lifting his head from bowing in front of Mila, Yulong looked at the blinking Shira, then smiled at the two cousins. “Thankfully, those trashes have already gone. So I guarantee no accidents will happen in the future.”

Since Yulong already pleaded guilty from the whole matter, naturally Mila let it go and focused on helping the crowd stop the fire before it spread somewhere else. Nobody there except Shira had a second thought on Yulong’s confession.

Shira really didn’t expect Yulong, the one who was supposed more solemn and strict than an ox, could actually tell lies with such a straight face. He was shocked by the revelation.

Eventually, an hour was needed to extinguish the fire. Yashura Family then fought the disaster with grit and grievance. But no matter how hard they tried, the Yashuras couldn’t manage to prevent great damage on the family’s proud wall and the surrounding wooden houses that innocently ablaze because the dry season brough the flames quite far with the help of dehydrated trees.

“Patriarch Shuro Yashura,” Baront Staterwind came in with solemn atmosphere, the trace of his previous politeness wasn’t there anymore, “my disciple Merly Yurrin and Esteemed Madame Ross wandered around in Yashura Family. But still till now, we can’t find them here; their aura we’re supposed able to track also vanish without a trace.”

The whole line of Patriarch Shuro’s family was nervous. Someone even gulped because of the tense mood.

Sir Baront continued, “We’re coming with friendly intentions, Patriarch Yashura, we just want to find them right now. So if you know something, please do tell us. Consider this I’m indebted to your Yashura Family.”

“Yes.” Patriarch Shuro understood the situation. He nodded gravely. Then he turned his head to his daughter Mila.

“Mm.” Mila Yashura understood the situation. She nodded solemnly. Then she turned her head to her cousin Shira.

Shira wanted to turn his head too. But Yulong, the one he thought knew the most, was too quick to move to manage people extinguishing the fire. Shira rubbed his nose. Everyone looked at him suspiciously, knowing that he was the last one who was with Mama Ross and Merly.

He himself wasn’t sure what was going on. So he had to lie, and said, “I don’t know. I don’t see anything.”

Baront Staterwind’s and Jerrin Yurrin’s faces fell. Eventually, Yashura Family could only offer an apology and ambiguously promised to find Merly and the lady Nalaq. Sir Baront Staterwind wasn’t happy, but there was nothing he could do since Yashura Family was the one who suffered the greatest loss at the end of the day.

Sometime later, Yulong the old butler was seen overseeing the servants to clean up the mess. Though Patriarch Shuro Yashura said he’d punish Yulong over the incident, the fact he was still able to command over the servants like usual, was akin to telling the outsiders that Yashura Family wouldn’t pursue this matter in spite of the heavy loss they’d received. Some spectators lamented that the Yashuras had gone soft, but in reality Patriarch Shuro Yashura just couldn’t do anything without Yulong’s directions.

“Yulong,” Shira stepped in to approach the old butler who was managing the workers cleaning the ruin, “can I talk with you a second?”

“What is it that young master needs from this old butler?” Yulong inquired with the usual polite smile of his.

Ensuring that no one else heard what he was going to say, Shira leaned in to whisper, “Don’t hide it from me any longer, Yulong. Tell me what kind of sect is hidden in Elzhier Family.”

Yulong looked at him puzzledly. “Why do you think Elzhier Family is hiding anything?”

“The only family who's been in contact with foreign sects in the last ten years is Elzhier Family,” Shira said unhesitantly. “I’ve heard Ryntia Elzhier was sending lots of trivial letters from overseas. People thought her not sending good stuff from outside means she lost favor from the sect that recruited her, but I don’t think a young woman from a no-name village would be able to live casually in foreign land if they lose the only foothold they have, no? At the very least, she’d marry a rich man or come back to this village if anything happened.”

Yulong smiled. “And why do you think they would be hiding only from the last ten years, young master?”

Shira didn’t expect Yulong would make things harder for him. He was already missing the old Yulong who was always nice to him.

“I’m pretty sure the expert who recruited Elzhier Family’s eldest young lady came from the same pack with the women that brought Merly and the lady Nalaq away.”

“Yes. But how can you be so sure?”

Shira frowned.

“Yulong, who’s your real master really, now?” he said carefully, naturally didn’t want to admit his ridiculous guess was based on the famous rumors of the said expert had her chest a bit too big than average beauties--something that he immediately linked to the nickname Good-Natured Spirit gave to their sect.

“Apologize if this old man offends you, young master,” Yulong said with an unhurried tone. “But due to my old duty for Sir Jhuro, I’ll have to make sure you prepare before you explore the uncharted side of Badril Village. But then again,” Yulong put his arms on his back and continued, “if you want to know some trivial matters, I guess I can help as long as you tell me what your current objective is.”

“That Lady Nalaq and the girl--I just want to fetch them back for Sir Baront and his party,” Shira said. “This mess started partly due to my fault. I’m more or less responsible in bringing both of them back unhurt.”

Yulong seemed to gather his thoughts for a second, with his pair of eyes that hadn’t had showing any sign of weariness due to old age landed on the boy’s face.

“I see, you indeed have matured too soon, young master. There’s nothing I could do to stop you if you’re this stubborn,” Yulong said while his head nodded lightly. The Young Master of Yashura Family was fifteen years old this year. One more year until his official age of ceremony. The more he grew, the more the butler worried about the boy’s apparent sharpness. “Although Malikh Family is the only one in Badril VIllage with a history of matriarchy in the past, in reality, the family where women actually have the most political power is Elzhier Family. They just don't show their fangs in the daylight. And they spread their influence and mingle with the common folks. So you won’t be able to contact them if you go through their main door. Go ask them for Elder Sheyla, young master. She handles their external matters and works in the open, so she’s the highest ranking out of them you can meet right now. And if anyone stops you--” Yulong plucked a pin of roaring lion he had on his butler uniform--it was the popular emblem of roaring Yashura Family, “shows them that you represent Yashura Family to fetch the guests they’ve taken.”

Shira received the pin from Yulong; there wasn’t anything different with the usual family’s emblem, from what he studied.

And the matter Yulong gave him the pin meant that, for whatever reasons, he wouldn’t get involved beyond this. As the one who felt the most responsible over the incident, Shira didn’t plan to rely on too much from him, anyway.

---

Elder Sheyla was born in Badril Village, had long found a successful life as a woman of career in Elzhier Family’s domestic politics. And the unusual big luggages on her chest--if following the thinking of Good-For-Nothing Spirit--would also reinforce the idea that this hidden sect was already being around in Badril Village for decades.

Shira couldn’t help but shake his head at the idea of hidden power controlling those usually smug Elzhiers from the shadow. If true, then no wonder Elzhier Family could easily retain their connections and had more assets and material wealth than what Yashura and Malikh owned combined.

“Oh, isn’t this Yashura brat?” a rather unpleasant laugh could be heard from behind.

Shira turned his head. The trio privileged young thugs, as he called them, Bony and his two friends Pilek and Polio, just returned from the river with a few freshly caught carp in their hands. The one who was laughing was that Pilek who always wore an idiotic grin on his face.

“I heard your girl ditching you for a rich boy, Young Master Shira,” he said with his grin, approaching Shira. “Don’t be too sad. Bhela that girl might not be fated to be with you, but hey, there are still many fish out there. Like here, you can marry this carp for life.”

Shira declined the fish Pilek jokingly offered. Seeing there was Bony there, Shira decided not to take Pilek’s joke seriously. “No thanks, I think you need it more since no girls ever accepted your confession.”

“You--” Pilek didn’t know what to say. His romance story was indeed more pitiful than everyone else his age.

“You’re going to Elzhier Family?” Bony who previously looked like he didn’t want to bother suddenly asked.

“Yashura Family is quite unlucky today,” Shira replied with a nod. Inwardly, he never thought he’d have a decent conversation with bullies who gave him many hard times in the past. “Someone got entangled in today’s accident and was in dire need for something. We’ve heard Elder Sheyla has this particular something and I’m willing to trade something for that something.”

Bony frowned, “What is it that you needed?”

“I want to engage in private trade with Elder Sheyla,” Shira also frowned, “you’re also someone who would inherit a major family, Young Master Bonithon, I expect you to know that I’m in a pinch to not leak sensitive matters.”

“Exactly because you’re going to inherit a major family, it’s best for you not to meet Elder Sheyla in private,” Bony said. “She’s an unmarried woman. It’s one year until your coming of age ceremony. And add that to the mess with Malikh Family recently. If people say you’re too bitter and want to run away for another, the talks will spread. You’re yourself should’ve realized how they talked a lot of shit about you.”

The reason for this was because she was an unmarried woman, and not just an ordinary unmarried woman--if the recent Bhela Malikh wasn’t so adored for her beauty and talent, any man in Badril Village would say Elder Sheyla was their goddess. The most beautiful and elegant woman in Badril Village, no other aunties could even compare. Even boys who still had snot in their nose aspire to marry a woman like Elder Sheyla.

Shira didn’t even know why Bony was saying so much. Until two years ago, these three delinquents had always been the first one to pick on him. This was even before his trash talent and his engagement with Bhela were a big deal. Shira didn’t know why, he just reckoned they had something against him.

And now look at this--a few years after the younger generations of Yashura and Elzhier didn’t bother each other, Bony somehow came out as a decent guy. For all he knew this guy and his cousin Mila were always fighting; maybe Mila’s punch to his nose back from the last time they fought two years ago made him turn a new leaf? Shira didn’t even know what really happened back then.

However, Bony didn’t even budge when Shira showed him the pin Yulong gave him. And not surprisingly he didn’t get anything from Bony. Shira began to think that getting inside Elzhier Family through bribing some guards and maidservants was easier than this. Without any more chit-chat, Bony, along with Pilek and Polio then strode away with a bunch of fish they caught, discussing merely how they’d cook the fish and what spice they were going to use.

And just when Shira was about to leave and about to decide whether to use the backdoor instead, someone poked his shoulder from behind.

“Wha--? You scared me…” Shira smiled upon finding the one who poked him only a girl of ten years old.

“You want to meet with Elder Sheyla?”

This girl also had a carp fish on her hand, and from the clothes she wore and the fact she was barefoot, Shira reckoned she was a servant’s daughter that came along with Bony to help them fishing on the river.

“Is there something you need, girl?” he asked awkwardly seeing the clear eyes of the servant girl staring deeply at him.

“Do you want to meet with Elder Sheyla?” she asked again.

Shira could only reply. “Yes, I have some business with her.”

The girl opened her palm.

“Can I see that pin?”

Since the roaring lion pin wasn’t that precious looking, Shira agreed immediately. It didn’t seem like the girl would run away as soon as she got the pin on her hands. Instead, she studied the pin with scrutinizing eyes.

“Can I get that again? There’s something I need to do, girl,” Shira said hurriedly. He didn’t have the time to humor a servant girl he didn’t even know her name.

Seeing the impatience in Shira’s eyes, the girl returned the pin back to him, plus a free coupon for a shop owned by Elzhier Family. “You should wait at my parents’ shop, Young Master Shira. There are free snacks to eat if you wait there.”

“No, like I said, I’ve got something to do.”

The girl blinked, still her eyes staring at him. Shira got uncomfortable. He didn’t even know why this girl gave him a free snacks coupon out of the sudden.

“Young Master Shira,” the girl said flatly, “if you want to fetch Young Lady Yurrin and Lady Ross, you should wait at my parents’ shop. Someone then will bring them to you.”

Shira was flastergabbed. Before even he could ask something from the girl, she already picked the bucket of carp and trotting away to follow Bony and others. It was later when Shira woke up from his daze that he realized he just talked with a member of the hidden sect.

The girl, who was only ten years old and barely developed, was undisputedly a member of the so-called Big-Boobs Sect. Shira’s face was grim realizing the whole matter was far more complicated than he thought.

What was making things more complicated was that he didn’t get to ask which shop her parents’ was.

After the masked women brought her away, Merly felt her head was heavy, felt like they made her inhale something hypnotic. Although her consciousness was a mess, somehow Merly able to retain her ability to measure time, and counting only an hour had passed since the incident in Yashura Family. Her blurry perception relapsed from time to time. She heard someone talking near her, but couldn’t make a sensible conclusion.

“…I did have my suspicions, but never would’ve thought Elzhier Family is Luna’s Elzhier that I always knew…” that was Mama Ross’s voice. She said more about Elzhier, but Merly couldn’t follow her words after that. But a moment later, Mama Ross’s grave tone nearly woke Merly up. “Who is the lunatic who dared to revive Gyl’s soul?”

Merly didn’t mistaken, Mama Ross’s tone now filled with grievance, the same grievance that she felt drove Mama Ross into trying to kill that evil, vulgar rogue Nalaq.

And the one who replied Mama Ross was a woman, whose voice was clear and beautiful, merrily said, “You shouldn’t have asked a humble member of the sect like me a question like that, Lady Ross. Fortunately, Sect Founder had been prepared for her sisters revival and left a message for you. She said that since the Liberators chairman gave his permission for you and the other pillars to take Mister Gyl down, certainly he didn’t need your permission to revive him as a Nalaq. It’s best for you to not pursue this matter.”

“Ha! Why still call us backstabbing women the Seven Pillars then? It’s nothing but glorify a compromise! Reviving that bastard brings nothing but disaster!”

Elder Sheyla politely disagreed. “Mister Gyl has been revived for years. And no such disaster like you were talking about has happened. He was being revived without his core memory was the only thing our sect don’t act on this matter.” She looked at the lady Nalaq. It seemed her words weren’t thorough enough for Mama Ross to calm down. “Please, Lady Ross, remember that you have Yurrin Family under your wing now. And also remember Young Lady Merly Yurrin is about to enter Blue Robe Society by the next year. You wouldn’t want to put this girl Merly in danger, would you?”

Mama Ross didn’t answer the woman’s question. Merly, as the contractor of Mama Ross’s soul, felt the echoes of the Nalaq’s fluctuate emotion; it was the same when Mama Ross descended into uncontrollable rage upon seeing the disgusting vulgar smirk of that rogue Nalaq. Only this time, as she inflicted by Mama Ross’s overwhelming sadness, she felt like her heart being sliced by a thousand cuts.

“Ugghhh…” a soft groan escaped Merly’s lips. She wanted to get up, but even her eyelids felt heavy. Her head felt like it shattered into pieces.

“Oh, you’re awake?” the woman’s voice directed at her. When Merly was able to open her eyes wide, slowly the face of a beautiful vixen entered her sight. Her smile wasn’t too excessive, yet, since Mama Ross didn’t like her, naturally Merly thus found this woman quite dislikable.

It was quite difficult for Merly to see what was going on. She held through, eventually, and found out she was inside a room that looked humble but had its walls extravagantly made with logs of aromatic sandalwood. Mama Ross was sitting beside her. Two other figures in the room were the vixen who later introduced herself as Elder Sheyla of Elzhier Family, along with a maidservant who was grinding herbal roots for the soup that was shimmering in the middle of the room.

Elder Sheyla used a pair of chopsticks to pick braised meat cuts that were sliced in uniformed rectangle, putting them into a bowl garnished with exquisitely sliced vegetables. The silent maidservant then carefully poured the shimmering broth, creating a clear harmonic sound as the warm water splashed onto the antique-looking ceramic bowl.

Smiling to Merly, Elder Sheyla said, “You must feel a bit heavy after inhaling our sect’s calming herbs. Please, Young Lady Yurrin, consider this as a gesture of apology from us.”

Initially, Merly wanted to refuse the other party’s offer. Calling a numbing poison a calming herb was an outrageous understatement. Yet Mama Ross told her to accept it. “Savor the soup, my dear. You’ll never got to eat this kind of meat again.”

“Sure the meat is rare,” Elder Sheyla laughed cheerfully, “even the core disciples of our sect can eat at most three serving each year. We are willing to part with it because we value Lady Ross’s past relationship with our Sect Founder.”

Merly didn’t know what kind of soup she ate that day. But she’d never forget the look on Mama Ross’s face, who seemed wry with awkwardness, almost telling her that as long as they got this soup as the compensation, then any grievance wouldn’t be too much to bear.

“Elder Sheyla,” a young flat voice of ten years old girl greeted after the door being knocked thrice, “Young Master of Yashura Family came to fetch the guests.”

“Is it time? Is the Nalaq still around?”

“Yes, he’s hanging around on the street like the usual,” the young girl replied.

“Then this isn’t the time yet,” Elder Sheyla said.

Merly just drank the broth till the last drop. Mama Ross told her to savor her bowl of soup clean. When Elder Sheyla asked her that question, Merly put down the ceramic bowl and bowed her head in gratitude. “Thank you for the treat.”

“Drink this tea too, Young Lady Yurrin, before you return to your people,” Elder Sheyla offered a glass of tea, which Mama Ross also told Merly to drink.

Meanwhile, one particular shop that Elzhier Family owned just lit their torches as the day was about to end. Shira sat alone, peeling a boiled egg he got for free, while his mind doubted the lack of customers since he got here was happening without any hidden interference. Yet everything looked normal. Even the hospitable pair husband and wife that ran the shop seemed like they were not people from unordinary origin.

“I saw your daughter today,” Shira said as he sprinkled salt onto his boiled egg. “Her face looks like she’ll be a great talent in the future. Any thoughts on sending her to school to study? Or sending to a certain sect?”

There was no one beside him and the pair of parents, so the husband responded to his words with a laugh. “Young Master Shira surely jest. Looks like our dearest daughter got praised because of a free voucher. In that case, please young master, tell us how you feel after eating this portion of free braised chicken on top of white rice!”

“Our daughter was lucky to be able to impress the aloof Young Master Yashura. Free voucher is indeed effective. We’re currently in promotion period, young master, please spread the word if you’re satisfied with our plates!” the wife said with a laugh as big as the husband’s. “Here, please drink this free avocado juice to accompany the free meal.”

Shira smiled dryly. The couple indeed knew how the world worked. He believed that the couple found out he was probing into the sect’s matter, and thus the bribe. They wanted to make Shira shut up with his curious questions.

As someone who was already experienced in taking dirty money from a certain rogue Nalaq, Shira surely wouldn’t shy away from free benefits. He took the plate and grabbed the spoon. Forcing a bunch of hidden experts to come out was useless anyway. Quietly ate his free meals, Shira believed the other party would come since they were already sacrificing braised chicken and avocado juice to make him stay obediently.

He was right. Halfway from cleaning his rice, the door inside the shop was opened. A maidservant was showing Merly Yurrin the way out. Shira quickly drank his juice, and asked the shopkeepers to wrap his unfinished meal. Since the wood plate already matted with banana leaves, wrapping unfinished meals should be easy. For people as great and magnomous as them, for sure they wouldn’t dislike a clueless boy for shamelessly asking to bring home a free meal, or so Shira thought.

“Haha, you surely jest, Young Master. As long as you come back again with your friends, you can take home as many as you want. Here, go bring this home.”

Shira asked to bring home his unfinished meal, but got a basketful of fresh banana leaves-wrapped braised chicken instead.

Somehow, Shira couldn’t help but took a liking toward these people with ulterior motives. Whether it was Good-Natured Spirit or this hidden sect members, they gave him free stuff. Shira took a mental note to visit Elzhier Family’s shops more often. Surely they’d welcome him with open arms, just the way Good-Natured Spirit used to act, right?

Shira escorted Merly Yurrin back to the inn she stayed in. When Sir Barront Staterwind and Jerrin Yurrin saw them, they were happy to see Merly unscathed. Shira used this opportunity to clear the misunderstanding between them. Surprisingly, Merly cooperated well. Maybe she finally saw the light after being forced to kiss dirt by those masked women. Or maybe the hidden sect finally put some sense in the high and mighty esteemed lady Nalaq about how to act in southern Mossacks’ homeland. Whatever the reason, in the end, the relationship problem Yashura Family had with their guests had been resolved before it became a real problem. Shira himself wasn’t expecting the problem would be this easy to solve.

---

It was already sunset when Shira walked back home. His mind wandered as he thought the diner would be tasteless. The shock today was too much for Yashura Family. Even the coconut lover uncle wouldn’t have so much energy to cook after this devastating incident. It was a good thing he brought a bamboo basket full of braised chicken wrapped in banana leaves with him.

Accidentally, a bunch of kids playing tag brushing passed him, almost making him drop the free food he got from Elzhier shopkeeper couples. He thought of scolding these noisy kids. But the sight of a young girl laughing made him recall the Elzhier Family’s servant girl, the one who gave him the free voucher, a girl he believed affiliated with the hidden sect. And then he remembered one thing.

“This pin isn’t even special,” he murmured, looking at the roaring lion pin Yulong gave him. But if it wasn’t special, why would a girl of ten years old decide whether to pass him to one of the hidden sect’s covered nests, based on this pin alone?

He felt it wasn’t strictly Yashura Family that the hidden sect gave face. His uncle Patriarch Shuro was honest and clumsy, unlike the profesional Yulong, so at least the honest faces of Yashura Family he knew wouldn’t hide anything like a hidden sect or some other worrisome secret. He believed in Yashura Family’s innocence.

And that was the time he realized the pin actually was a bit different than a normal one. There was a dent on its surface. The more he looked at it, the more he was convinced that the dent wasn’t there accidentally. It was made to cover one of the lion’s eyes.

“One-Eyed Lion.” A long forgotten phrase escaped his lips. One-Eyed Lion was the name of a delinquent group that his father made during his youth, that eventually won battles against bands of bandits outside and successfully secured a path for merchants to safely trade with Badril Village, finally made a name for himself. When far away villages heard of Badril Village, they’d immediately remembered Jhuro Yashura and his gang the One-Eyed Lion.

Shira didn’t know much about his father. He was almost never staying at home. And Patriarch Shuro, as gullible as he always was, never asked what his brother did outside the village. A headache came to him when he realized a bunch of mess he’d had to straighten out by the time he would inherit the patriarch mantle.

“Yo kid, I saw you visit Big Boobs Sect’s place,” a haughty voice was heard. Shira groaned, quickly hid the pin he got, seeing the main nuisance finally showed himself again, with a cigarette between his fingers, carefreely floating with a punchable smirk on his face.

“I thought you died.” Shira scoffed.

“What? The fuck did I do?” Good-Natured Spirit groaned as if he was wronged. The boy’s indignant eyes seemed to blame him upon the whole mess. “I didn’t do anything, alright. I did play my guitar, trying to flirt with her, but suddenly she wanted to melt my face with fireballs. What a salty bimbo, tsk.”

“I saw you disrespected that lady Nalaq.”

“Ey, I just touched her butts a little bit. And that was after she went nuts with her fireballs.”

“I have the feeling you met her before and did her a great injustice. She was trying to kill you, like, really hard. Maybe she’s someone from the time when you were alive?”

“Don’t know. Told you I don’t remember things from back when I’m alive.”

“Then do you have any idea why she hates you so much?” Shira asked. “Aside, you know, your assault earlier. Some lady had a death grudge with you--maybe you two really knew each other before.”

Good-Natured Spirit had a thought about this. His face turned solemn as he replied, “In this world, I fear no man, kid. But jealous ex? I fear them.”

“It’s unbelievable to see my Yashura Family take the hit while you are still shamelessly living and kicking,” Shira clearly didn’t believe what Good-Natured Spirit said. “No, I forgot, you’re dead already.”
