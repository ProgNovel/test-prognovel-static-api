“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”

Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”

“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”

“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”

“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”

At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”

“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”

“You mutt! It’s Young Master Bonithon, don’t embarrass our family by following those crass people calling him Bony!” Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me anyway?! It’s not his turn to show up here. Go, go kick him out! I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”

“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”

“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus because he’s young, but he won’t have guts doing stupid things! Go, kick him out!”

Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of _that_ family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”

“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”

He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”

Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. It was somebody else without any mark of Malikh Family’s emblem. And before he knew it, this particular someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.

“Gaaahhh!”

Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when he squealed like a pig people torrent to drag the assaulter away from him.

“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.

Bony, the man who beat the bald elder mercilessly, replied with nothing but a cold stare.

Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead. “Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk. “You wouldn’t lose to a duel, won’t you? Boss Bony here is a Knight but he doesn’t even use his sword!”

Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!

The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”

Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, giving harsh jeerings in return.

Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly.

He randomly approached a Malikh Family’s servant, pulling his lips ugly, sneering, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”

_Shatter!_

Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.

On the other side, Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting foreign guests she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.

“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.

Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.

“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”

“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”

The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.

She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”

Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.

“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel, I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is me the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please send her a letter telling that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”

Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”

“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.

By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.

“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”

The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when the fight was chaotic, nobody could watch everybody, thus the sharpest mind with tricks were the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.

For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”

And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.

With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.

Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.

At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.

A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the rules to only fight unarmed.

“Huurraaah!”

Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemingly to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.

It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.

The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.

Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.

The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya.

“A Samurai!” Polio exclaimed the moment the Kaya man approached him.

The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”

Then, still ignoring the sword in his belt, he grabbed Polio and flipped him onto the muddy ground.

Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.

The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.

As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.

Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.

“Kkuuuggghh!”

Bony prevented himself getting throwed around like a sack. But instead he got struck in the gut.

What happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.

Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.

“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.

Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.

Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”

The young ruffians with Bony as the leader couldn’t act arrogant anymore. They retreated, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason for why did Bony come targeting Malikh Family, nobody would ever know.

After Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.

“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.

“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”

“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”

Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.

Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”

“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”

Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.

Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”

The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.

Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.

Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.

There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.

And then…

“_Cough, cough…_” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.

He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”

Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”

“No, it’s not that.”

Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”

“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.

Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”

“No…”

“Then why?”

Monkey sighed.

“Because he’s already gone home!”

Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.

Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.

Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.

On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.

Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”

Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”

“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”

“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.

In a room where Patriarch Ghalim Malikh rested on his sickbed, Grandpa Piss and Snotty both had swirled black liquid-filled flasks in their hands. They had deep frown on their face. Even after drawing Ghalim Malikh’s blood for the forth time, they still didn’t come to the conclusion for the the patriarch’s illness diagnosis.

More exactly, they didn’t dare to.

Sitting on the corner of the room, the pale Madam Malikh, bit her bottom lips, asked with griviance filled her voice, “My husband was poisoned, wasn’t he?”

She stared at Snotty, the one who looked awkward and had a hint of guilt in his face, because before Grandpa Piss wasn’t really willing to give her a definite answer even to the simplest question. Snotty, feeling stuck between two hard places, could only glance at his grandfather; the answer to the madam’s question wasn’t something he could afford to mess with.

Grandpa Piss felt his grandson’s difficulty. So instead with a kind grandfather’s smile plastered on his face, he replied, “Don’t worry, Madam Malikh, Patriarch is merely had problem is his diet. He got an allergy to some food he ate few days prior to his ill. Just make him drink this and let him hydrated all the time, he’ll be back in two weeks time.”

Madam Malikh lowered her head. The more Grandpa Piss smiled and the more Snotty tried to follow suit with the awkward smile of his, the more they looked like quack doctors. This only made Madam Malikh felt indignant in her heart and tried to reason herself from throwing these two fakes out from Malikh Family.

---

Four people sat on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were Bhela Malikh’s personal guests, and were invited by her to a secluded place far away from the courtyard which was still in chaos due to Bony and his cronies crashing the ceremony.

The kitchen aunties--not the usual young maid servants--came asking them for the sort of refreshment they’d like to be served with.

Half of the guests Bhela invited here were raised in families ridden with political intricacies. Seeing the lack of proper maidservants in order, more or less they could guess the relationship Bhela Malikh had with the people who currently ruled the Malikh Family.

“Still,” the middle-aged woman said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass were only interested in her being the top grade during the seminars. That is the only reason they let me leave my post for this trip. How about you, Mister Harrington?”

She glanced at her travelling partner. But the middle-aged man, Harrington, who was already monopolizing the lantern, stuck himself in the corner as he wrote fervently in his worn-out journal.

“Forget it, I shouldn’t ask,” the middle-aged woman rolled her eyes. She glanced at the two other guests, whom she hadn’t acquainted, personally. “What about you two, gentlemen?”

“Quite interesting! This village is!” the bearded red-haired man replied with a laugh. “It’s not everyday you two girls fight it out in some catfights girls are used to having. These lasses are very much different from the noble young ladies you see in the city! This village’s sure quite something, hoho.”

The man talked with a boomed voice and merry tone, probably because he was under the influence of tuaq, an alcoholic drink concocted by locals. He raised at the bottle of tuaq Malikh Family had, he drunk a lot of it but still he lamented, “Their tuaq isn’t that impressive though.”

The Kaya swordsman who kicked Bony and others out was sitting beside him. He glanced lazily and said, “You don’t get to drink good tuaq in Malikh Family. Elzhier and Yashura made better tuaq, but Yashuras only serve their in-house brewed tuaq only to their close friends, and you’ve got to have some use to Elzhier Family if you want bottles of tuaq from them.”

The middle-aged woman looked at the eastern man. That was the most words she heard from his since tonight.

“Is this not your first time here, Mister Kurusiya?” she asked.

The Kaya man named Kurusiya glanced at the woman. He didn’t like it when people probed into him, especially ambiguous with a smile speaking as if nothing happened, thus he coldly spoke, “I drank their tuaq before.”

The bearded man got interested and asked, “Oho? Which families’ tuaq you’ve drunk?”

“The three of them.”

Someone knocked the door indicating they’d want to interrupt their dialogues. Bhela, leading the kitchen duty aunties, came in bringing the serving meals for the guests. In usual Mossack private festive people ate cross-legged on bamboo-woven mats and put the food on the floor, often on top of clay plates--but, if the host prepared enough, they came with cleaned fresh banana leaves and spread the rice, chicken curry, half-cut cured salted eggs, fresh vegetables and so on and so forth on top of the leaves which often left the impression of authentic feast for first time tourists. In spite of that, the middle-aged woman and her travelling partner had a more pressing matter in mind, and Kurusiya didn’t care about the meal; which then left the bearded man to wolf down the food though he ate a proper meal recently during the Ngajen Ceremony feast. The feast upon the banana leaves was basically he ate himself.

“So it’s true,” the bearded man pondered, speaking while getting his bare hand dirty eating the food at the same time, “special guests got special meals during this so-called Ngajen Ceremony.” He looked at Bhela, this girl he hadn’t much interaction with during the seminars because he was an instructor for a different field than archery. He didn’t even recall he had a proper conversation with the girl. But the girl took the role along with other kitchen aunties that came with her as the server, pouring water into the glass, thus the man acted friendly nonetheless. “Back in the ceremony I heard you took the role as Chief Chef, so I assume you cook this yourself?”

“Yes. The aunties also prepared rendang braised since before the Ngajen Ceremony started,” Bhela said.

“Oho, rendang, finally!”

As the host Bhela was quietly pleased with the man’s enthusiasm. “Please do try our stewed carp, Sir Baront Staterwind. It cooked with my mother’s maternal family’s secret recipe.”

“Secret recipe? Interesting!”

The bearded man Bhela referred to as Sir Baront Staterwind was excited trying Malikh Family’s cooking. Actually, he barely had something to do with the matter that brought the two other guests--the middle-aged woman and her travelling partner--to come to Badril Village. But the year’s brightest seminar student invited him to, and he happened to a big fan of travelling across Mossack cultures and cuisines. Thus, here he was.

“Girl,” the middle-aged woman curtly criticized from the side, “amongst my students I adore you and I know you like to do things independently--but to lower yourself to do maid’s chore is too much for seminar alumni.”

Bhela looked at her and softly said, “Please don’t take offense for this, Madame Sylvia. It is our custom for the woman of the house to serve the important guests of the house.”

Eastern swordsman Kurusiya, who began annoyed with the glutton bearded man beside him, correcting Bhela, “Madam of the house would be required to serve her husband’s important friends that are coming to the house--that’s the original Mossack custom you’re talking about.”

Bhela looked at the eastern Kaya man, though was talking about a custom not of his own people, had a tone of criticizing her. She didn’t take it to the heart. “You are right, Mister. I’m sorry for my ignorance.”

The middle-aged man who was busy writing before slammed his journal to the floor. “That’s not important,” he said. “Bhela Malikh, I’m your elemental affinity instructor during the seminars, but you never told me about your four elemental affinity. What’s the meaning of this?!”

This question Bhela had prepared for an answer before.

“My friend I considered as a sister told me not to reveal it in the seminars, Mister Harrington.”

“And you trust your friend more than your teachers?”

“Yes,” she said, as a matter of fact. The girl wasn’t afraid of the eyes of these elders staring at her.

“You….”

“Apologize, Mister Harrington. It's just that my current talent is a rather sensitive issue and some people would go a long way to make me join their faction. I invited three of the most suitable factions I think the most suited for me to continue developing my talent in.”

Bhela didn’t say that somehow, because of her relationship with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, her secret was leaked earlier than she intended and more or less resulted in tonight’s noise during the ceremony.

“Three of us?” The middle-aged woman, Madame Sylvia, curtly smiled as she glanced at the uninvited fourth person.

Kurusiya knew what her glances meant. He put down the glass of tea he currently drank, said, “I’m not in business in the girl’s future study, I’m here to visit my Ghalim Malikh.”

“Are you friends of my father, Mister Kurusiya?”

“Friend? No. Ghalim, Jhuju, and others are just some rebellious brats to me.”

Listening to Kurusiya’s apathetic tone, Bhela blinked her eyes. Her father was nearly forty, but the Kaya man sitting before her looked the same of her father’s age--probably younger. Besides the greying hairs people would think this eastern swordsman was at most thirty.

Kurusiya continued, “I’m here waiting until they finish diagnosing your father. This fellow here drags me because he doesn’t know anyone to accompany him to feast more than he should.”

Baront Staterwind nodded then immediately went back enjoying the food.

“If you’re waiting for Old Doctor to diagnose my father, Mister Kurusiya, he’s already done. You can visit my father now.”

Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to diagnose the ill Patriarch Ghalim Malikh. Hearing they were done, Kurusiya preparing to leave. Inwardly, Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington were delighted that their competitor was lessened by one.

Kurusiya caught the gloat on these foreigners’ eyes, though their lips smiling in friendly manner. He was never fond of those who harbored hidden designs. So before he walked out of the room, the man turned his head, casually throwing a question out of nowhere, “Girl, what is your relationship with Ryntia Elzhier?”

Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington immediately became alert. They came from the west, and they didn’t expect a name they heard often mentioned casually in this room.

Bhela was also confused. Nevertheless she replied, “Ryntia Elzhier is my friend. She admitted to a sect in the far west ten years ago, but we regularly keep in touch through letters.”

Though her words were light, Bhela saw the expression on Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington became restrained. The girl raised her brows thinking her words must be wrong somewhere.

But then Kurusiya asked again, “Then did she give you a favor when she helped get you admitted into those two years seminars?”

Madame Sylvias’s and Mister Harrington’s expression changed again. Bhela finally aware the Kaya man felt annoyed and deliberately sowing doubts for the other guests.

“It’s just a favor between friends. Us girls from the same village naturally Sister Elzhier would lend her arms whenever she could,” Bhela quickly said. Before anyone could say anything, she stood up and offered to walk Mister Kurusiya out. “Please, Mister, I’ll show you the way to my father’s room.”

After Bhela accompanied the man to her father’s place, the room descended into silence. The middle-aged woman Madame Sylvia and her travelling partner retreated into their own train of thought. Sir Baront Staterwind, on the other hand, wasn’t bothered enough with it since he didn’t come from the west like the other two, and his superiors actually weren’t expecting for him to recruit the girl since they didn’t employ that many archers nor wizards in their faction.

Unexpectedly, when Sir Baront Staterwind reached out for a glass of spring water, he heard the aunties that came with Bhela whispered in the corner. “Isn’t that dog supposed to be at least fifty years old? How come his face looked so young?”

“I don’t know, why ask me?” whispered the other aunty. “Previous Patriarch Yashura’s people always been the weird ones.”

Baront Staterwind became interested in the aunties’ gossip.

“This lady,” he said, “is the previous young lady who fought Bhela came from Yashura Family you’re talking about just now?”

Two aunties didn’t expect the esteemed guests would talk to them. “Yes, it is mister.”

“What’s that Kaya man has to do with them?”

One aunty replied, “He didn’t tell you, mister? Kurusiya is Yashura Family’s guard captain from the previous generation. Young Lady Bhela doesn’t know, but everyone from the previous generation knows about him. They say, that man killed a lot of people under the previous Patriarch Yashura’s order. But we never left our village so we never know the truth of this matter.”

“Lots of them he killed,” another one added with a nod. “After the previous Patriarch Yashura was gone he retired from his position. After that he wandered outside like a vagabond. Last time people talking about him he spent his retirement teaching his swordsmanship to previous Patriarch Yashura’s son, Jhuro Yashura.”

Sir Baront Staterwind knew that man had a lot of blood on his hand even if these aunties didn’t tell him. Probably more than them. Since both of them travelled toward Badril Village, they decided to share the same carriage as to split the cart rental. Although they were acquaintances, they weren’t close enough for Sir Baront Staterwind to know Kurusiya’s past.

What Sir Baront didn’t expect the man’s had history with this barely known village.

“Yashura Family is powerful, but nowadays we call them Toothless Yashuras for a reason,” seeing that the guest was interested in their story, the aunties excitedly gossipped, “current Patriarch Yashura’s a cook--people like them but compared to his brother Jhuro Yashura and his father the previous patriarch he doesn’t worth that much. And the next one, their heir, aiiisshh… how should I say this? He’s rather... untalented.”

The other aunty quipped with a regrettable face. “It’s our Malikh Family’s bad fortune for our excellent young lady to get entangled with that declined family.”

Hearing this Sir Baront Staterwind was smiling. He washed his hand from spring water provided in a wooden bowl, then he said amiably, “I saw a boy came forward after Bhela’s duel ended. Is this Yashura Family’s heir the one who picked up Young Lady Yashura?”

“That’s the one! It’s Young Master Yashura, mister. He isn’t even looked that handsome for Young Lady Bhela, is he?”

Sir Baront Staterwind was polite, he just nodded to accomodate these gossipy aunties. Inside he remembered what he saw during the short duel between Bhela and Yashura’s Young Lady, and he remembered how Bhela’s magic arrows vanished before they hit her opponents.

He picked a fresh fruit to nibble and hummed. While the other two guests Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington were thinking about their chances to recruit Bhela into their faction, Sir Baront Staterwind, the third guest Bhela personally invited from the two years seminars, already looked the other side of the pasture. He decided to pay Yashura Family a visit tomorrow.

In the meantime, on the other side of Malikh Family resident.

Bhela walked the eastern man to her father’s room. The place was devoid of servants as always, only a pair of grandpa and his grandson hung out just outside the room, nibbling steamed peanuts while idly watching the moon.

“Oh, Kurusiya, you came,” the old Grandpa Piss was beamed with smile when he saw the Kaya man approached them with sword hanging on his waist. It was bad manner to get close to people with weapons, sheated or not. But Grandpa Piss and Snotty was happy to invite Kurusiya to eat steamed peanuts with them. Bhela on the other hand went in to ask whether her mother needed anything. Kurusiya wasn’t polite like he was with the previous guests and picked a few peanuts as soon as he sat.

“You want to see Ghalim,” Grandpa Piss said, “I suggest you don’t.”

Snotty added from the side, “Madam Malikh hates us to the bone. She even swore us when we told her Old Madam was the one who sent us.” the muscle man was nervous, drenched in cold sweat. “It’s really lucky no one beside us heard what she said about Old Madam was, I guess Uncle Ghalim never really told his family about Old Madam. He’d never tell them how scary his grandmother can be.”

Kurusiya followed the pair’s advice. Madam Malikh’s maiden family lived in the neighbor village about two days walking in the north, so he wasn’t familiar with Ghalim’s wife that much.

“What happened?” he asked.

Grandpa Piss told his story. The grandfather and grandson diagnosed Patriarch Ghalim Malikh was simply had a weak digestive system. Madam Malikh wasn’t convinced, and she politely told them to scram as far as possible. But how could the famous Medicine King and his heir ran away just because a madam dissed them? Therefore, Grandpa Piss and Snotty would create an excuse to stay in Malikh Family in case something happened, at least for tonight they’d stay overnight. Both Snotty and Grandpa Piss talked a lot but they didn’t really answer Kurusiya’s concern; for them to be forced to play quack doctors, there ought to be something going on.

Therefore Kurusiya leaned on closer, asked, “Tell me, Grandpa Piss, what was the thing that took down Ghalim?”

Grandpa Piss’s face that previously beaming turned expressionless. “I can’t tell you yet, let’s wait hearing what Yulong has to say.”

Kurusiya reacted with his eyebrows knitted. Grandpa Piss might have to ask the old master’s and old madam’s opinions on big matters, but he supposed to not needing answer to Yulong.

Snotty knew what the Kaya man had in mind. He said, “Let’s just wait, Uncle Kurusiya. Honestly Grandpa and I rather not get our own family entangled in this matter.”

Then Grandpa Piss told Kurusiya they already sent words to both Yulong in Malikh Family and old Madam Malikh, Ghalim’s grandmother. Old Madam Malikh sent Grandpa Piss and Snotty to check her grandson’s condition, while Yulong priorly informed Jhuro Yashura to send Kurusiya back to the village dealing on the matter.

Since Old Madam Malikh’s live on the other side of the continent, words might delayed a few days, so they only waited for Yulong’s response instead.

And thus, they waited, an owl flew above their head and landed.

With an iron clipping Grandpa Piss picked the hidden letter from the owl’s throat. He read and then he put down the letter and let the owl flew away.

He looked at Kurusiya, Kurusiya leaned to listen.

“Yulong said to let you deal it as needed, so I’d just tell you what really happened to Ghalim; he was poisoned,” Grandpa Piss said solemnly, “by Jhuro Yashura’s poison.”
