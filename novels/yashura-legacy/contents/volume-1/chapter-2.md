Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.

But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.

“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”

“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”

Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.

Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.

“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”

“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”

Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”

Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.

Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”

“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--

“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”

“We’ll support you, Young Lady!”

“Don’t be afraid!”

The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.

“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”

She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.

---

“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.

Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”

“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”

Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.

“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”

“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”

“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.

“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”

“I wouldn’t know.”

“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”

Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.

“This kind of thing…”

A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.

It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.

Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s **Alchemist** workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.

“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”

Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.

“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.

“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”

“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.

The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.

“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.

Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.

“Le… letter…”

The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.

Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.

“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”

As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.

Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”

“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.

“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”

“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”

The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.

“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.

Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.

The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.

“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”

Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”

Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.

“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.

“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.

“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.

“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.

Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.

For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.

At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.

“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”

Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”

“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”

“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”

“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”

“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.

“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”

“Don’t push it, old man.”

“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”

“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.

“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”

Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.

While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”

Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.

“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”

Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”

“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”

Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.

In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.

“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”

Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.

“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”

“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”

Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”

But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”

Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.

“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”

“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.

“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.

“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”

“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”

“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”

That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.

“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”

Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”

Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.

“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.

“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”

“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”

Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.

“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.

Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.

The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”

Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.

“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.

“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.

“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.

“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”

Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”

“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”

As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.

“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.

“Thank you, Yulong.”

As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.

“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”

Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”

The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.

Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”

“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.

---

After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.

When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.

Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”

Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.

“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”

“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.

“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”

“I’m all ears, Yulong.”

Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”

Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.

Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”

“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”

Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.

“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.

“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.

“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.

“No, the insult.”

Good-Natured Spirit grinned.

“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”

Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.

“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.

---

Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.

“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.

Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a **Status Window** on him?”

Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”

“Hah, his **Dodge Rating** getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.

“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! **Strength**, **Agility**, **Dexterity**! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the **Wisdom** attribute now!”

“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”

“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”

“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”

Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.

“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”

“Who said that?”

“People.”

“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.

“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”

“Oi, mind your words!”

“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”

“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”

“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a **Specialist** like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”

“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”

Mila pursed her lips.

“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”

“Her hair?”

“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”

Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”

“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”

She smirked.

“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”

“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”

“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”

Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”

“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”

“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”

“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”

“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”

Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”

“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.

Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.

Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”

“It’s **Water** elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”

“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”

When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were **Fire**, **Wind**, **Lightning**, and **Water**--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.

“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.

“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”

“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.

Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.

Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”

She nodded.

“Uncle awakened his rare **Poison** elemental affinity.”

And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.

There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.

“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”

That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.

“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”

“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”

“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.

“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”

Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.

And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.

“Monkey!”

The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.

“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”

Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”

“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”

“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”

“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”

“What’s with the master thing?”

“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”

“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”

“What kind of spice?”

“All kinds of spices.”

“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”

By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he _reluctantly_ admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”

Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”

“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.

The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.

<novel-trivia label="lore">

Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.

</novel-trivia>

The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.

“This is a **Boost Elixir** concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”

Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.

“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.

“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”

Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.

“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.

“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”

“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”

“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not _normally_?”

“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”

Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.

Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”

“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”

“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”

Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”

A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.

“You’re the Alchemist?”

“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.

One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.

Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”

“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”

“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.

Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.

“What kind of elixir is this?”

“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.

“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”

“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”

“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.

“Yes. Do you mind?”

“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.

Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.

Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.

“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”

Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.

“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”

The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.

The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.

“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”

“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”

It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”

The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression

As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.

“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.

Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”

After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.

“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”

“Oh, yeah?”

On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.

“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.

“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”

“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”

“Worried? Why?”

“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”

“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.

“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.

Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.

“What secret?”

Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.

“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”
