title: The Generation's Best Unique Class

Badril Village was the same as always. The place and the people, it was the same Bhela remembered back from before she travelled for seminars across countries. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. Yet from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.

“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”

Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.

“Which rumor?”

“Oh, silly you, of course _that_ rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”

Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.

“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”

“Really?”

“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”

Bhela looked at them calmly. Inside she found it amazing how people could conjure their own stories despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.

And just when the young ladies about to get excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s “love life”, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.

“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family patriarch’d be such big person to be able throwing their weights around to Ngajen Ceremony’s host!”

Curious guests tailed the hurried Malikh Family elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.

Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger.

“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.

Romana was beside her, warning her, “You, don’t be hasty! Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking gossips about Bhela, and then eventually they’ll start to talk about your cousin. Against bullshit your cousin is usually having I-don’t-care attitude, do you think his social reputation can survive if the topic taking an unexpected turn? Do you want to make it worse for him?”

After hearing her friend’s elaborate warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear a few people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really lousier than he usually was. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.

Mila took a deep breath again. Released it. She looked at Romana and asked.

“Where’s that kid right now?”

“Shira? I think he went hiding!”

“Hiding?! Suddenly he cares about face and know what is shame now?”

After searching around a bit, Mila and Romana found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.

“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.

The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family until at least a few years after my coming of age ceremony--but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”

“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”

“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”

“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”

“You tell me.”

“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. They say the unknown goldsmith was \_the \_legend. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”

_...whisper whisper whisper..._

Mila stepped in.

“Ey, what are you doing?!”

For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Snake, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.

Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… _rendang_ you guys were eating?”

“_Cough, cough,_” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”

Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.

“Ah, my rendang…”

“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”

“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.

Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl Bhela didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s all just formalities, sooner or later they’re going to announce it was a mistake and people would forget about it..”

He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”

“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”

Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”

Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.

Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll eventually drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. You won’t notice it until later you take patriarch’s mantle from your uncle. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”

Shira usually wouldn’t mind letting Mila have her way with her reasoning, but Romana, her friend, was a daughter of a family elder from a smaller family than Yashura, they knew their stuff and Shira always thought Romana had some talent her father had. Shira and older generation Yashuras didn’t really think about this engagement deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married--but mostly because the one who started, Shira’s father Jhuro Yashura, almost hadn’t been home dealing with details to make the engagement looked real. At worst when things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but Romana seemed to suggest the young generations who were exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently.

So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right.”

“Of course we are right!” Mila sneered.

Shira rolled his eyes. Anyone who didn’t contribute in thinking things through shouldn’t have acted high and mighty in front of him.

Monkey, who was silent before, cleared his phlegm and showed his support. “What are you gonna do now, Young Master? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”

Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. It wouldn’t be too bad if we make some ruckus a little bit.”

“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.

“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted. “And please, Mister Monkey, Mister Snake, this is family’s matter, you don’t have to worry about it.”

Mila insisted, “Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”

Shira shook his head.

“Let’s go,” he said.

“We’re gonna slap her face now?”

“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are from the younger generation. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”

Shira was sure about this. Because hardliners and conservatives usually were from the older ones, people who didn’t meddle much on gossip and such.

Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. At least, the boy said something. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change his mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.

The two exchanged glances.

They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.

“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.

Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.

But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”

“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.

Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”

“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang once a year!”

“Fuck off!”

“Give me that!”

“No!”

Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.

“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.

For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.

The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”

Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.

“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.

“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.

The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over people with background, rather thick-faced to continue despite young master of the noble family rolling his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.

“Ah, Sister Bhela!”

“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”

“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.

Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She asked him instead of replying the greeting, “Is Lyla resting well?”

“It’s been five days since she came home, she has been much livelier than from two years ago--thanks to you.” Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled. There was a hint of impatience behind his smile, not wanting the conversion indulged in a topic he didn’t care about, thus he said. “Instead, I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady. I didn’t have the chance to have my rest. So may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”

“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.

The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”

She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.

“Greeting, sir, madam.”

“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”

There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”

“Lead the way then.”

Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela approached them to apologize in person.

Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”

“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they’re relatives from her maternal family.”

“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”

“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father was a gangster when he was young so it’s understandable for him to fail teaching the young lady common sense. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”

After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that they weren’t able to watch the fun they expected to see. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?

---

The Ngajen Ceremony started about five decades ago, evolved from solemn sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods, where fads and trends emerge. However grand their way of life was changing, the conservative major families--Yashura and Elzhier--when it came to the tradition, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially the prayers, as the slightest bit of deriving the tradition would receive nags and complaints from the previous generation elders. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that was eager to move away from the tradition with stride intended to be impressive; doing that, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer. Under Elder Jhamil’s impression he’d make sure his Ngajen Ceremony wouldn’t be embarrassing in front of the noble guest.

After the praying was done, Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests.

“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was the Malikhs’ excuse.''

“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said.

“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs at bay, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to make some visiting noble feels comfortable? Bah!”

Romana nodded along. “Malikh Family is so stupid.”

“That what I was saying!”

While voicing out her complaints, Mila liked to act impressive and cocky, with her head held up high, chest upward, but in her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.

Romana also had food in her hands, no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.

Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet, acting moderately as a normal guest supposed to be.

Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”

Shira had his arms crossed while he savored a wet cake he managed to snatch from a busy Malikh Family’s servant. He looked at her, eyes lazily half-closed, asked, “And like what?”

“We can’t wait for something to happen!” she said. Originally they planned just to show off their face, but they didn’t expect for Malikh Family to be shameless enough to even thrown away traditions. For opponents that didn’t care about face, Mila thought they ought to be more proactive. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”

Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired _young lady_.”

Romana laughed. “Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. I heard names calling for the Malikhs much worse than yours because the foreign priests matter!”

At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snort back as a retort.

“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.

Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”

“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego--nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh heh… she dares!”

“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”

“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! We must, because people have eyes--and they also have noisy mouths! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”

Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”

Romana shrugged. Folks back in her family never did set up engagements before--it wasn’t common for the southerners. Actually, neither of the three of them knew what was proper for engaged couples.

Shira didn’t like the idea Mila spouting. He argued, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Mila, are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”

Mila hid her gasp.

“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”

Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.

“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”

People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood. As it turned out, while Shira and Mila were debating about what they should do, the stylish young noble instead had led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.

“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”

Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary expression on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”

“That slut!” Mila hissed.

This was getting serious; whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.

“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.

“You too?”

Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he didn't care would only embarrass him further.

In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”

“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”

Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not let a single smile escape, Young Master Blackwood could only smack his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.

Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.

But unfortunately, things wouldn’t go as smooth as he wished to.

“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a roar of a young woman’s crashed upon the merry festive, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”

Mila Yashura strode forward. She snorted, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.

Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheathed weapon in his cousin’s hands.

He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happening.

With every firm step she took, Mila's face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”

“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”

“You lying slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”

“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare strain in her voice showed that she was upset, but since all Mila did was sneering, it was pointless to explain anyway.

“I don’t care what your excuse is!” Mila spat. “Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re so good, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”

Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”

Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.

“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”

Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.

“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.

“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”

Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.

On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”

Shira put his hand on Monkey’s shoulder. “Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting this mess. She can’t afford to have people think she’s chickened out now.”

Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.

Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Your cousin’s only good when it comes to raw brawl without using skills and mana. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late, now?”

Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.

Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. Yet doing this way was a bad idea either, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just admit surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.

Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.

“Who is that girl who’s picking a fight with Bhela?”

“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.

“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”

“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago. She didn’t even have the talent to attend schools or any sects outside this little village.”

Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.

Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”

“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”

“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”

“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have been here….”

Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”

In the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, witnessed the commotion from afar. The middle-aged man was frowning to his thought, but the middle-aged woman was interested in knowing Bhela’s two other guests; an eastern Kaya man, sipping his tea, leaking a sharp aura that with his bringing that could only formed from habits and his everyday’s business. One other guest was more relaxed, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd while occassionally rubbed his beard watching the spectacle with interest.

In the meantime, Elder Jhamil saw his arrangement didn’t come as smoothly as he wanted, came forward to invite himself as the judge of the two young ladies’ duel. For a chance to humiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for a better opportunity.

“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hits your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to both sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.

Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”

“I don’t need that,” Mila laughed sarcastically. “You want an excuse to escape when I kick your ass, aren’t you?”

“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil. Elder Jhamil nodded at her.

Then came the countdown.

The duel began.

“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.

Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.

The wind began to stir.

And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.

_Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!_

Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.

Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.

_Clank!_

The first blue arrow disappeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind disappeared almost immediately. Mila, though she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slip her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.

Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with a complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.

“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”

Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed with his trembling finger pointing at Bhela.

Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, bowed to him from afar.

“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.

The woman sitting beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”

The man looked at the woman, he said still with an expression of disbelief, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”

“Yes, yes, you already said that.”

The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?

“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”

“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”

As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.

“She didn’t stop it.”

“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.

The one she was talking to was the quiet eastern man with the sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman was still confused, he explained with a hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”

The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”

The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”

The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.

“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile. “I saw how it was done with my own eyes.”

Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin Shira come to pick her up.

“I lost,” she said to him.

Shira looked at her, taking time to choose his words carefully, said, “No you didn’t. That girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you have won.”

“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”

Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adults problems from hereon forward. Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back and make him talk seriously with Malikh Family. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.

Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed his pitiable cousin, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.

“Brat,” someone called him.

Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.

“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.

Shira nodded.
