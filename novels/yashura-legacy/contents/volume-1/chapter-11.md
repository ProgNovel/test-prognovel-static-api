Shuro Yashura had a little black cow friend he called Beefy. Beefy was a high grade cow born from a superior breed that was the best cow Yashura Family could afford in these past decades. Days upon days, Shuro Yashura would be laughing across the barley field as Beefy chasing him from behind. They played, they happy, they were best friends forever. Shuro Yashura loved Beefy. No one could break them apart. For years, it was Shuro Yashura’s lifetime dream to make the greatest beef rendang ever from Beefy’s tender meat.

“Until then, we’ll be best friends forever!” Shuro Yashura drolled, patting Beefy’s firm fatty meat, while wondering what kind of delicious texture Beefy’s meat was going to offer.

Unfortunately happy time was short. Soon, incoming evil approached in the form of Elder Fhantir.

“Patriarch Shuro, we need to repair our wall but we’re dirt poor. We don’t have any choice.”

Shuro Yashura instinctively took a step back, protecting Beefy’s fatty body. “What do you mean, Elder Fhantir?”

Elder Fhantir’s face formed an evil grin.

“We need to sell Beefy!”

Shuro Yashura gasped.

“Beefy, noooooooo--”

Patriarch Shuro abruptly opened his eyes.

“Beefy!”

Short on his breath, Patriarch Shuro found himself sweating in his bed. He looked around his bedroom, confused. In the same room he saw his wife tidying clothes, and was looking at him strangely.

“Oh, dear, are you having a nightmare?” his wife asked.

“Nightmare?” Patriarch Shuro wiped sweat off his face. “Yeah, yeah, nightmare. It was only a nightmare. Heaven, I really thought Elder Fhantir’s gonna sell my Beefy…”

Relieved, Patriarch Shuro lying his head again on the pillow. He had been under heavy stress that he encountered a really, really terrifying nightmare. He needed a good rest.

However, just when he was about to sleep happily again, his wife uttered, “But isn’t Elder Fhantir going to sell all of our cows to Elzhier Family today?”

Patriarch Shuro, who was already smiling comfortably preparing to fall asleep for the second time, abruptly opened his bloodshot eyes.

“BEEEFFY, NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!”

Shira was a neighbor to his uncle’s house. He just locked his door when he heard his uncle screaming this morning.

“What now…” he sighed.

Though he had something to do this morning, Shira thought it best if he checked out how his uncle was doing. After all, his uncle was left devastated after Elder Fhantir decided to sell off the entire family’s cows.

The main family’s houses in Yashura didn’t have any exotic decoration nor they had expensive decoration, but their style of home for living was strikingly different from the common family members’ houses. As Yashura Family was the most conservative family than the two other major families, their taste in everyday architecture leaned more on the traditional side, as seen in the Patriarch’s main house still use old staged, wooden home style that installed two feet tall stairs to reached the door--the style of house that were commonly found in places where monsters swarm frequently struck, just like Badril Village was a few decades ago. The only thing that made Patriarch’s house different than simple folks’ staged house was the entire wooden house varnished with lacquer, down to its wooden floor, as varnishing wooden house required a quite sum of money these days. His uncle’s house was varnished, but his didn’t. When Shira visited his uncle’s house, he noticed the brazier in the yard was still sparking embers. He picked a wild twig and put out the fire as to save charcoal, thinking that Mila who usually put out this brazier as one of her daily errands must be still asleep for her to miss this out.

Shira then knocked on the door. “Uncle, aunt, can I come in?”

“The door is not locked,” a voice said, not from inside, but from the veranda where Shira was standing.

“Mila?”

“I’m here.” Apparently, Mila, whom Shira didn’t notice when he climbed the two feet tall stairs onto the veranda, was sitting there in the corner near the window.

“What the hell are you doing…” Shira sighed as he squatted before a blob of bedsheet.

Mila covered her body really well. Shira couldn’t even see her but her eyes peered through the slight gap on layers of the bedsheet.

She said, “My mother told me to go outside to do my daily errands--but I don’t feel like doing it. I’ll stay here chilling to waste my free time.”

“No, I’m talking about why you’re covering yourself like this. I really thought you were dirty laundry just now.”

“I’ll have you know! I’ll have you know, aisshhh! It’s Elder Fhantir! He confiscated the cosmetic Grandpa Piss gave me! He’s going to sell it to Elzhier Family!” Mila hissed with a voice full of seething anger. Maybe if Elder Fhantir wasn’t her senior and one who was regarded as the pseudo Grand Elder of Yashura Family, Mila would pull her sleeves and come to fight him to death in order to protect her cosmetics.

Shira, on the other hand, had a complicated feeling after hearing that. He couldn’t but asked, “I understand if Elder Fhantir sold the family's property to repair our wall. But did he really take your stuff by force?”

“Well…” the voice from the blob of bedsheets was dragging, “he did say he would contact Grandpa Piss to send another one next week but… how am I supposed to protect my skin until then?!”

Turned out the one who was unreasonable was Mila in the first place. Shira felt he wasted his precious twenty seconds for his time sympathizing with this block headed cousin of his.

“Stop this Mila, you’re making yourself looking like a fool,” Shira said.

He pulled the bedsheet from Mila, but the girl hissed and struggled.

“What are you doing? You’re exposing me naked!”

Shira immediately took his hands off the bedsheet. Grimaced, he asked, “What? You’re not wearing any clothes?”

“No! I’m not applying my skin care!!”

He just realized Mila was in that kind of phase where she was worse than when she was on her periods. Throwing his hands off the air, Shira left his cousin on the veranda and continued to enter the house. From his aunt he learned his uncle also on that kind of phase where he’d spend in bed, depressed.

Madam Yashura sighed, “He always has a soft side like this. Why couldn’t he be more decisive like his brother? Will Yashura Family be okay if our patriarch couldn’t even get himself straight?”

“Aunt, don’t worry,” Shira said, putting down the glass of soybean milk his aunt gave him, “I can substitute for Uncle Shuro on the family hall breakfast this morning since Elder Fhantir’s going to take over the session anyway. Elder Fhantir needs to officially announce his decision to repair our ruined wall, so people wouldn’t notice much if Uncle Shuro absent.”

“Would that be alright?”

“As long as Uncle Shuro is fine on tonight’s council meeting, I can’t see reasons for elders would make things difficult for him,” Shira said, confident that more than half of the elders would find excuses to avoid this morning breakfast in family hall, thus as long as Elder Fhantir spared his uncle, it should be fine not attending the morning assembly.

And it turned out his guess was correct. When he came to the family hall, even the common family members, upon seeing Elder Fhantir had taken the stage, had the face of pretending to see nothing and immediately sneaked out before they were noticed. This made Shira wonder whether those people really were more afraid of Elder Fhantir than the prospect of having Yashura Family’s authority crumbled away slowly. People wouldn’t notice if Patriarch Shuro was absent this morning--only because most of them were busy hiding in their own home trying to cook up excuses to be absent themselves.

Fortunately, Yashura Family wasn’t as hopeless as it seemed to be. Amongst the minority of elders and common family members who stayed in the family hall, most of them had put solemn expressions and listened to Elder Fhantir’s announcement, eyes brimming with concern. Amongst these faces were traditionalists and hardliners of which Patriarch Shuro always avoided--because if troubles invited debates, the patriarch had never even once won an argument against these people.

And so the talk went on for a half hours. After the breakfast session was done in the family hall, Shira came to talk personally with Elder Fhantir, who detached himself to smoke a pipe as soon as he had the chance to do so.

“Elder Fhantir, please take a look at this,” Shira softly placed a wooden box in front of Elder Fhantir.

“A box?”

“My private stash,” Shira said.

This was his secret box he had since he was a child, the only one who knew it existed only people who lived in his house--himself, and his father Jhuro, who never stayed home.

Elder Fhantir opened the box, then closed it again after he took a brief peek. This made Shira’s smile turned wry. He expected Elder Fhantir would grill him half to death over the content of the box, but got speechless by Elder Fhantir’s lack of reaction.

“What?” Elder Fhantir grunted. “You want me to nag over the reason why you have so much precious stuff on you? I already know you are hiding your wealth even though you haven’t yet going through your coming of age ceremony.”

Shira was silent. Exhaling lines of smoke through his nostril, Elder Fhantir continued again, “I’m not blind. I knew what you were up to something since months ago. Previously, I don’t know why you have so much money to befriend an outsider peddler to work for you. But after all those Nalaqs nonsense happened, I reckoned there no need to ask you now.”

Boys and girls of southern lands were expected to focus only doing daily errands for their parents until the day they were treated as adults on their coming of age ceremony. If the elder willing to let it go the matter of him breaking rules, then surely Shira wouldn’t complain. “Please be free to use it as you see fit. To leave a leeway for our family’s next month Ngajen Ceremony is all I’m asking you.”

“Hoo, you’re trying to negotiate--I thought you saw the errors of your way and came to ask for forgiveness because I’m scary.”

“Elder Fhantir, that’s basically my entire saving I had on me currently,” Shira said with a helpless smile. He didn’t expect the old elder to tease him.

A young man shouldn’t be too impudent and Shira certainly knew his line. Elder Fhantir’s face was apathetic, yet his eyes still clear enough to see sincerity in the boy’s face. He knew that this young master of his was negotiating not for himself, but for his uncle who was devastated in his own bedroom.

“Very well,” Elder Fhantir dropped his smoking pipe. “Tell that uncle of yours I will leave only one cattle for him to slaughter in the next Ngajen Ceremony. But I will still sell the Wagyu breed that fool uncle of yours always talked to. I can’t give him that cow, it’s the reason why Elzhier Family is willing to buy our cattles in the first place.”

Ah, in the end, Shira couldn’t save his uncle’s Beefy from being sold by Elder Fhantir. Poor Uncle Shuro--Shira wanted to help him but Elder Fhantir was just too strong.

It was just sad. But what was more sad for him that the fact before he entered the family hall, Shira was the richest kid in the younger generation of the entire Badril Village--stepping out of the family hall he was dead broke. Shira originally wanted to save a few for his pocket money before Monkey and Snake come back bringing the fruits of his investment, but he didn’t out of guilty conscience. Not to mention Elder Fhantir’s glare giving him an incredible emotional pressure--now he somehow knew why people avoid Elder Fhantir as if their lives were on the line.

“I did hope everything’s going to be fine next month,” Shira said to himself. If Yashura Family still a mess the time Monkey brought him money, then he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if he didn’t face Elder Fhantir for the second time.

After having a breakfast Shira circled around the yard and checked the street where Good-Natured Spirit always hung out smoking cigarettes, wanting to earn some money out of him. Shira didn’t find the Nalaq, though, even after searching on the hill behind Yashura Family still he couldn’t see the annoying cocky smirk that always greeted him with half-harmless verbal abuse.

Shira then went down to visit his uncle’s home, wanting to find an errand that could generate him some money. He just realized as he itchily rubbed his nose that the prospect of holding no wealth made him very restless. He was restless enough to the point he’d go scraping for pennies. There got to be something he could do to earn Kobe coins.

“Why don’t you open your own food stall?” his aunt told him when he asked for some work. While generally working and opening business before coming of age ceremony was looked down upon, but most boys and girls still able to earn pocket money by taking advantage of the running errands for their parents. “Your uncle made quite a lot of fortune when he was young by opening his own food stall, you know. Aunt originally preparing Bulayak Satay for launch, there’s a whole pot of Bulayak Satay sauce back in the room. You go ask the kitchen for leftover chicken innards, then you can use Aunt’s Bulayak sauce and sell satays at the mountain’s foot.”

That was actually a good idea. If his guardian was the one who took an initiative to send him on an errand where he could gather some money the old people--even hardliners like Elder Fhantir--they wouldn’t be able to question him of breaking the rules out loud. Amongst the three members of Patriarch Shuro’s family, Shira always knew his aunt was the most reliable of them.

The young masters of big families usually had many ways of getting money secretly through connection. Some privileged young masters like Shira, had people like his aunt and Butler Yulong he always relied on. Eventually, also with Butler Yulong who made things smooth behind the scenes, Shira set off from Yashura Family pushing a portable stall in form of a cart, with the destination of Badril Mountain’s entrance--commonly known as the border between the village and mountain full of monsters--a place where hunters and teenagers who wanted to raise their levels by fighting monsters usually hung around in search of team party or preparing for their adventures.

He began grilling Bulayak Satay as soon as he unloaded his cart and his food stall assembled at the place reversed for Yashura Family’s people. Before his satays get done not many people interested in his shop. However, as the smokes from his grilling satays spread across the place, some older people then came to him with their faces sullen as if Shira did them wrong.

“Isn’t it too soon for you to set up your business, Young Master Shira?” an old hunter said to him.

Another one said, “Our kids are following our ancestors' rules not to be too mindful about money before their coming of age ceremony, Young Master Shira. You came from Yashura Family, I know; but if you break customs so blatantly, wouldn’t that be a bad example for other kids of other families, no?”

These people were from common origin, but their tones were particularly harsh seeing Shira trying to earn money for himself. Southern Mossack culture didn’t lack a caste system, albeit vague and hadn’t had the inequality class struggles problems like more sophisticated society of the western empires and the easterns kingdoms did. Poor and rich were commonly seen dining together at the same table during ceremonies. Peasants and masters were usually laughing and farming together under the scorching sun. And because of that, it was understandable for random folks berating young masters if they were crossing the line.

Though unfamiliar to the experience, Shira knew this. Thus he previously prepared an excuse so people would leave him earning money in peace.

“I’m opening my stall under my uncle’s order,” Shira lied with a straight face. “My Yashura Family recently got in trouble financially in case you don’t know. So my uncle told me to get some money for disaster relief fund. Try this, this is the famous Shuro Yashura’s secret Bulayak Satay recipe.”

They didn’t believe Shira at first. But upon tasting the Bulayak Satay themselves, these complainer relished themselves in the deliciousness of the satays.

“Ah, it really is Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay! I’d be damned!”

“How long was the last time I eaten satays from Patriarch Shuro’s food stall?” the other one lamented the fact that with no social status, eating food that was personally cooked by Patriarch of Yashura Family was only a dream. “I can’t believe you can replicate the same taste of Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay, Young Master Shira. I thought it could only be done only if you share the same kitchen with Patriarch Shuro at least for twenty years! To think you have this kind of talent, you’d be a great Patriarch Yashura in the future!”

“Yes, yes, of course,” Shira humbly nodded at the sudden sung of praise given to him. He knew his uncle’s name alone could make his food stall best seller in the village if he wanted to, thus he unashamedly took credit over the Bulayak Satay’s sauce that his aunt had prepared for him beforehand. “Do you like it, dear customers?”

“It’s Patriarch Shuro’s secret Bulayak Satay recipe. What’s not to like?” one man said with a friendly smile.

Shira also began to smile friendly, “Thank you. That would be thirty five Kobe copper coins.”

And abruptly the original friendly smile froze flastergabbedly.

“What?! Thirty five?” one man slapped his thigh in anger. “Patriarch Shuro only sold his Bulayak Satay for five copper coins back in the day!”

“Ah, that was more twenty years ago. Dear kind uncles, have you read something called inflation? Should I enlighten you with a lecture on basic economy theory?”

The complainers learned this Yashura Family’s young master was actually hard to deal with. They left unhappy after paying for the Bulayak Satay they had eaten.

After that, with the help of his uncle’s reputation as one of the best cook in Badril Village, Shira didn’t encounter any difficulty selling his Bulayak Satay anymore. People came, at times even forming a line, which was rare for other food stalls. The amount of money flowing in made his smile become more slick and natural as the time went by. Indeed, as they said, even rice could taste as sweet as sugar cane if earned with the good ol’ honest hard work--although in Shira’s case, half-honest half-hard work, since he should credit his aunt for preparing the Bulayak Satay.

“Business is good, good good good.” A voice intrusively came from his side when Shira’s thought entrapped by the coins he was counting. Shira raised his head--not surprisingly, Good-Natured Spirit came uninvited as always.

“Ah, where were you before, I was searching for you everywhere.”

“Kid, adult got stuff they have to deal with,” Good-Natured Spirit replied as he bent with a cigarette on his lips, lighting it with the flame made by fresh charcoal that Shira had just thrown it. “What do you searching me for anyway?”

“Well, I sought you to play chess. But I’ve got stuff to do deal with so I currently can’t humor a _busy_ adult like you. Maybe later before evening. I’m free around that time.”

Good-Natured Spirit chuckled, too lazy to counter the boy’s sarcasm. “Alright, man, call me anytime whenever you ready to lost your soul.”

Shira had never worried about how he’d win the game against Good-Natured Spirit--the bet he’d extort him was the place he needed to get creative, instead.

“Why the fuck you Yashuras always made your charcoal from goddamn coconut shells?” Good-Natured Spirit groaned as he had difficulty lighting his cigarette.

“Don’t ask me. We’ve been overwhelmed by coconut ever since my uncle took the position of the family’s head,” Shira said. Even this Bulayak Satay, unlike any other satays specialized in other families, used coconut milk and red spices as the base for its sauce instead of the earthy, creamy peanut sauce Mossacks’ satays always known for. There was a reason why Patriarch Shuro had the best Bulayak Satay recipe, but sucked at making other kinds of satays.

It wasn’t even two hours since he opened his food stall. The amount of customers Shira had dwindled after people began climbing the mountain to either hunt for monsters or training their levels. With the outrageous amount of revenue he got after exploiting his uncle’s name, surely his aunt wouldn’t complain if he ate one or two portions of Bulayak Satay for himself. And thus under the carefree sun Shira had his leg crossed lazily, eating grilled chicken innard satays with the spicy but mild Bulayak Satay sauce, Shira talked some useless stuff with Good-Natured Spirit who was smoking beside him to pass time.

“You should stop talking to yourself. You’re making me ashamed for having you as my fiancé.”

The one who was talking before him was the Young Lady of Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh. She came with archery gears, complete with half-breast armor for female archers used to not having her things got in the way of her drawing arrows, and the famous icy face that wasn’t smiling; anyone could guess she didn’t come here to say hello to her fiancé. She came purely because she overheard Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay was being sold once again.

Shira thought it was his bad luck, the first day he opened his food stall he met someone he’d rather not meet the most. Especially when the bastard Good-Natured Spirit was around only to laugh at him.

“Two portion Bulayak Satay, put it in one plate,” Bhela said in business-like manner.

“Do you want to eat here or wrap it home?” he asked.

Bhela didn’t immediately answer, she glanced at the stack of clay plates stacked for consumers who wanted to eat on the spot. “How much would you sell for one clay plate you have?”

“This is not a wareshop,” Shira remarked.

One glance was enough to tell she wasn’t happy. She said coldly, “I have a friend. We’re planning to eat here. But I don’t want her to meet you.”

“Hah hah, sure you don’t. Though I would appreciate it if you didn’t say it aloud. Here, I’ll give you one plate you can bring home for fifty Kobe copper coins.” Just get the hell out of here--Shira’s sour tone implied.

For the first time Shira was grateful that Good-Natured Spirit--who had been rolling on the floor from his hysterical laughing--to not revealing himself to the common eyes. And he also felt lucky for having a face thick enough to maintain his poker face as he wordlessly prepared Bulayak Satay for Bhela to take out.

Just as Shira was about to complete the order, Bhela said something to him, “Just so that you know, Young Master Blackwood is a certified Level 13 Knight class who studied under a veteran of the royal knight army. Compared to that, your Level 3 Novice status isn’t worth mentioning.”

Giving the Bulayak Satay Bhela ordered, Shira said, “It’s very nice of you to be concerned for your _real_ fiancé. But please don’t have to worry, I have my own plan.”

Bhela frowned.

“Making a contract with an evil Nalaq isn’t a smart plan,” she said flatly, and said nothing afterward. The girl turned around and leave immediately as soon as she paid for the Bulayak Satay.

Shira sighed. Everyone always said that he was the luckiest boy in Badril Village to be promised the village’s most beautiful and talented Bhela Malikh--yet, in his honest opinion, his noisy cousin Mila Yashura was cuter than this proud peacock who always had the expression seeing everyone else was beneath her. A fiancée who looked down on him on the front, and envious young men from behind, truly--Shira lamented--if he wasn’t the unluckiest boy in Badril Village, what was he then?

“Kid, your girl is pretty hot, alright, but I think there’s something wrong in her head,” Good-Natured Spirit said solemnly as he patted his ethereal clothes from invisible dusts. “How come a handsome me could be evil?”

“Oh, yes, you’re not downright evil.” Shira nodded. “Lecher, maybe, but not every degenerate are plain evil like their haters believe.”

Good-Natured Spirit looked at him with eyes narrowed. He recalled the first time he revealed himself in front of Shira, the boy was alert and conscious of his own words and actions. Yet, some months later, and many games of chess later, this kid got cocky and never really put him in his eyes.

“You know,” Good-Natured Spirit after a click of tongue, “that Bimbo Nalaq was worshipped by her girl and their relationship is pretty healthy. I’m not asking you to worship me, but at least you Mossack people should respect a Nalaq, no?”

“I recall you said you’re not a Nalaq some time ago. One thing about respect, Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit, it is something earned--so maybe if you don’t make troubles all around the place I’ll kneel in front of you.”

“When was I making trouble? The fuck did I do?” asked the guy who been mocking him and laughing out loud before. Talking with Good-Natured Spirit somehow made Shira’s mood even worsen. “And who the hell gives you permission to talk some fancy shit?”

“I’m not the one who’s saying it. It’s Yulong.”

“Yulong, eh?”

“Yes, Yulong--why you’re having that kind of face whenever it’s about Yulong?” Shira asked.

Good-Natured Spirit sneered between smoking his cigarette. “No meaning, I just find the old prick’s too pretentious. It’s annoying.”

“You should stop. Yulong is a good man.”

“Oohhh… really?” the nalaq sneered.

“Well, at least he’s sophisticated,” Shira said, then, with a low voice, he inquired, “Yulong somehow knew about the sect in Elzhier Family. He’s someone reliable, don’t you think.”

“Heeh, I wouldn’t know,” Good-Natured Spirit acted as if he didn’t care. But Shira caught his eyes winced a little.

The boy didn’t say anything excessive after that. For the leecher Nalaq to hold himself back from making misogynist jokes when there were chances, he knew Good-Natured Spirit had a thought on his own. Shira, too, pretended to know nothing and continued selling Bulayak Satay liked he did before. It was because of Yulong’s name. The Nalaq’s sudden alertness made him able to confirm that he was able to safely extort Good-Natured Spirit so many times without getting retaliated--because Yulong, from behind, was watching over him.

“Your girl, anyhow, feels that it's beneath her to get engaged with Novice trash like you,” Good-Natured Spirit suddenly said with an out-of-tune voice that was unusual to him, “why don’t you prove her wrong, eh? I still got Training of Hell for you to get stronk fast, remember? The offer still stand. You’ll be crowded with chicks if you follow my way.”

They had discussed this before, so Shira replied with the same answer. “No,” he said, “I have my own plan for this. Even if Yashura Family doesn’t get lucky with Sir Staterwind’s offer, there’s no need for me to sweat blood and tears just so that girl can have her own satisfaction.”

Shira might be not able to beat the noble young master from that Blackwood Family. He didn’t have to. When no one expected him to win the only thing he should avoid was to drag Yashura Family’s face down the mud--as long as he able to lose with grace, anything else fine.

“Where are you going?” Shira asked when he saw Good-Natured Spirit arose from his sitting.

“I’m gonna familiar myself with some chicks.”

Shira didn’t want to see the Nalaq when he out harassing girls with his invisibility. So he didn’t make him stay.

Good-Natured Spirit floated away as if he did the usual business and looked for some eye candies. But the moment he got out of the Shira’s line of sight, he appeared again, somewhat hidden in the crowd, crossing his arms with cigarettes between fingers he watched the boy carefully, eyes narrowed sharp.

It had been months the Nalaq realized he couldn’t beat the boy with only game of chess. He realized, as the time went by, Shira became cocky in front of him, and more so in the past few weeks. And now that the kid realized he got some backers watching over him, Good-Natured Spirit thought he would become even more cocky, and he didn’t welcome that quite nicely.

“Heehh,” he snorted. He turned back and floated away as Shira suddenly became busy with the second wave of customers.

One thing that made Bulayak Satay stood out was its use of coconut. Bulayak Satay wasn’t the only satay recipe that used coconut milk as its base for the sauce, but it certainly widely known for wrapping Lontong with coconut leaves. Lontong was rice steamed in wrapping, was plain but filling. A famous travelling consineur once called it “solid boring porridge”, which was a praise for staple grain to support the rich taste of spicy dishes that Mossack cuisines known for. In any other satay dishes, however, Lontong always synonymed by color green, since it was commonly made by putting washed rice on green banana leaves and left it cook under steam heat.

Reason for why Bulayak Satay different; the coconut leaves first weaved into a cone or long tube before filled with rice, resulting in the same but quite different Lontong that people normally eat on any other dishes. Granted, Bulayak Satay maybe wasn’t the only one dish that use coconut leaves wrapped Lontong, but a certain patriarch/coconut scholar would argue that if served with ordinary banana leaves Lontong, then Bulayak Satay would be nothing but ordinary satay with spicy coconut milk sauce. This patriarch/coconut scholar happened to be the best Bulayak Satay maker in the whole Badril Village, so his words were pretty big deal back when he said that. This was why in Badril Village Bulayak Satay was synonymous of coconut leaves Lontong.

The one who explained this was a maidservant of Elzhier Family named Nilda Elzhier. Lyla seemed to be listening while she dipped the long Lontong with spicy coconut milk sauce, mostly because Nilda also taught her the way to enjoy Bulayak Satay properly, which in Lyla’s experience, quite novel and enjoyable compared to peanut sauce satays Bhela always gave her.

“I like this Bulayak Satay! Why don’t aunties in the kitchen never make Bulayak Satay, Sis Bhela?”

“Because Yashura Family makes the best Bulayak Satay, though they don’t sell it very often,” Bhela said, recalling the last time she had eaten Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay was when she was seven.

Today, thing Lyla liked the most about Bulayak Satay--aside the taste--was the joy when she unwrapped the coconut leaves Lontong. Nilda taught her to open on one end, then let the gravity unwhirled it opened partially so that she could eat it while holding the wrapped side. With that, there was no need to use spoon or fork to enjoy Bulayak Satay.

“Whoever thought of this is a genius!” Lyla exclaimed as she bit the dipped Lontong.

“Mm,” Bhela hummed, took a bit of one satay. Her face might not look like it, but she was happy seeing that Lyla had a very healthy appetite.

The three of them were squatting behind a shop owned by Malikh Family, hiding from the public sight. After all, although Lyla had disguised herself with common clothes, there always chances that people might wonder the origin of a girl they didn’t know. They didn’t want that. Even though the Elzhier Family’s side promised Bhela to obstruct Butler Tim and Elder Jhamil’s faction from finding her and Lyla.

Meanwhile, Nilda the maidservant was watching the two of them from the side. Originally, Bhela ordered Bulayak Satay for two people, and Nilda thought the two girls would share the food like sisters. It was true they shared the Bulayak Satay, but Bhela seemed to touch no more than three satays, while the rest were wolved down by the glutton Lyla.

“Is it fine to let Young Lady Lyla eat all the food? Isn’t you have big meal when having breakfast before?” Nilda asked, concerned by the pure glutton by the name of Lyla Blackwood.

Bhela looked at the maidservant, replied straightforwardly, “It is fine.”

“Yeah, it’s fine!” Lyla howled. “Back in my home they always give me a small plate of meat while call it high-end cuisine! What high-end cuisine? If it can’t fill my belly then it’s not worth being called cuisine! Bulayak Satay is the real high-end cuisine--Badril Village food is the best!”

“You sure are very happy visiting Badril Village, Young Lady Lyla,” Nilda said with a smile.

One striking trait that Nilda had noticed when watching Lyla ate was that the Blackwood girl’s skin was bright and healthy, seemingly nourished by a very expensive tonic. Nilda also noticed Bhela’s skin became more beautiful than the last time she saw her, but it was nowhere near Lyla’s that would make even the prettiest girl envious.

“Young Lady Bhela, are you using cosmetics given by Medicine King to Young Lady Lyla?”

Bhela looked at Lyla’s bright and healthy skin. “Yes. Nobles like Blackwood Family loved to use mercury powder to whiten their skin, so previously she wasn’t always like this. It’s very fortunate the cosmetic gifted to me can revitalize her malnourished skin.”

“How envious of you two can maintain your beauty with Medicine King’s cosmetic,” Nilda the maidservant lamented. “I heard Yashura Family sold their Eldest Young Lady’s cosmetics this morning, but Aunty Niu Elang sent those cosmetics back to the sect for disciples to compete for. I heard the girls in my sect all going crazy fighting for them.”

Bhela blinked upon hearing the maidservant mentioned the sect. All she knew about the faraway sect where her friend Ryntia Elzhier studied was that it was well-connected, resourceful, and was boldly an all-girl sect in the midst of patriarchal society. Not much beyond that her knowledge about the place. But today she learned, apparently, it was the kind of sect where its disciples fight each other over some cosmetics.

“Is Sister Ryntia alright there? I have used the cosmetics only once both for me and Lyla--if Sister Ryntia wants it, I can send mine since we don’t really put attention to this kind of things, anyway.”

“You don’t have to, Young Lady Bhela. If our Eldest Young Lady really eyed the cosmetics then there wouldn’t be any competition in the first place.”

Bhela insisted, “Why don’t you do me a favor and inform her later whether she has a friend who also wants that cosmetic. Just count this as my thanks for the helps during my time in the seminars and for bringing croissants the other day.”

“Yes, croissant!” Lyla quipped. “Let’s barter that cosmetic with croissants instead! One cosmetic, with croissants this many!” she said while holding a bamboo basket almost twice the size of her belly. Barter cosmetic made by the famous Medicine King and a basketful of pastries; her face was unusually solemn as if she just presented a very good deal, honestly believe a cosmetic that sought by many nobles and royals, worth pastries that could only fill her belly for one day.

Conversation got cut off when Nilda felt at loss seeing her serious expression. The girl indeed was too easy to get excited. There was no use explaining things to Lyla if she didn’t get it. A pat on the head was all Bhela did to calm the excited Lyla. And eventually, the supposed noble Blackwood young lady lost interest and began on chugging fresh coconut that prepared for her beforehand, then for some reason she broke into a dance and began to sing, completely forgetting about her outrageous deal. It just how Lyla was being Lyla.

---

Originally, Lyla and Bhela spent some times eating Bulayak Satay not just to hang around. They planned to climb the mountain after all.

But Badril Village mountain was known to be hostile filled with beast and monsters--and in the more scarier, deeper place, roamed by the feared Selaqs. Some places were relatively safe but it was already a norm for those who wanted to climb to form a party first, adventuring and leveling together while they were at it. Unfortunately, the only sect members in Elzhier Family Bhela could borrow was this lass named Nilda. Therefore, she had to invite some more reliable youngsters to accompany her to hunt games on the mountain.

The problem was if she sought people without others’ help she’d only attract boys that wanted to hit her. It was fine if they only annoyed her; Bhela could just send them off with a cold glare, they wouldn’t dare to bother her the second time. But Lyla was different. Bhela didn’t want some flies getting close especially when Lyla had her head-in-the-cloud moment.

“Where’s your young master, really? Setting off when the sun is hanging high is undesirable,” Bhela said to Nilda.

“I’m sorry for the inconvenience, Young Lady Bhela. Unless it was Eldest Young Lady, we don’t have much voice in voicing influence in the main family--especially for Young Master Bonithon Elzhier. If it’s alright with you I will go to see whether my young master is ready with his friends.”

“Then you’ll be inconvenienced by me, many thanks.”

Because of the treatments she always got whether in the village or overseas, Bhela hadn’t trusted boys. But toward Bony Elzhier it was different. Not because she trusted his personality, but because she heard some secrets from his elder sister, Ryntia Elzhier who studied on a sect overseas, a secret good enough to put him in his place. She trusted this secret that the well-known delinquent Young Master of Elzhier Family wouldn’t want to hit on her or Lyla--the problem was two of his lackeys, however.

“Young Lady Bhela,” Pilek, one of Bony’s lackeys, approached with grinning face, “I heard Malikh Family is hosting a very noble foreign young lady. Would it be possible to introduce me to her, eh? Eh?”

“What?”

It wasn’t Bhela who responded, but a girl who was squatting beneath a tree, who chewing on raw grass. Whenever Bhela wasn’t looking Lyla always been naughty, it just so happened that she was curious whether Paku Grass would become sweet if she chewed it long enough, just like Aunty Yaya told her.

Pilek gloated. Anyone who was idiot enough to imitate goats chewing on wild grass surely wasn’t anybody important. So her ignored the grass-chewing girl and continued on pestering Bhela, saying, “Please introduce me to Young Lady Blackwood! I’ll owe you a lot!”

Bhela just looked at him coldly with her mouth shut. It was Lyla again who jumped and snarled, “Who are you?”

Against a strange girl with such a rude and grassy mouth, Pilek lost his patience and rolled his eyes. “And who are you? What are you doing eating grass anyway?”

“Paku Grass is edible! Granny Litha said so!”

Before Pilek could even scoff her stupidity, Bony came to slap his head from behind. It seemed Bony was sensible enough to realize the real identity of the weird girl.

“This is Lyla, my cousin,” Bhela introduced only after Lyla felt happy seeing Pilek’s wronged face, while her fingers busily forcing Lyla to spit out grass the naughty girl just ate.

Bony said, “I received some coins from Elder Shyla and tasked to accompany you adventuring the mountain.”

“I just want you to guard Lyla. Don’t bother with me, I can carry around myself.”

Bony shrugged. He got paid and the client had the right to tell him what to do. Thus, after telling his lackeys to check on their equipment, he told them their task, “You two guard Bhela’s cousin closely. I’ll be at the tail.”

“You’re guarding the back, boss?” Polio asked. “And with Bhela at the front, what danger should we’re guarding her from?”

“Maybe we should keep an eye on her so that she doesn’t eat any other weird things, like grass, for instance.” Pilek from the side chuckled.

Bony slapped the back of his head again. Pilek almost cried felt wronged because he didn’t know what he did wrong.

“Just keep an eye on that girl, don’t say anything unnecessary,” Bony said solemnly. “And also--don’t argue with her. Just don’t.”

Bhela saw the boys discussing their things through, then turned to Nilda to ask, “Does your young master know about your sect?”

Nilda shook her head. “Aunty Niu Elang decided not to involve too much of the family into sect matters.”

“Then he shouldn’t be informed about Lyla’s identity.”

“Well, young lady, anyone could guess when Elder Jhamil sent their men all around the village to search for her,” Nilda said with a smile, lightly hinted with her eyes to the girl who was sneakily looking for something she could chew.

---

Later on, they climbed Badril Mountain with a party of six people. Bhela as the Archer and the scout was at the very front, traversing the moldy stone stairs of the mountain, picking routes based on her memories two years before she attended the oversea seminars.

Bony committed as the most senior and a Knight class fighter with the highest level to guard the party’s back, resting a big machete on his broad shoulder, wearing no armor beside coarse clothes he wore this morning. From the talks of the peddlers and travelers, those southern fighters with Knight class were more crude and practical than their westerner peers--the westerners which were always gallant, always speaking about honors, always clad in steel armor and always had their own insignia embedded on their shield. Their southern peers instead were simple. They were known by their brute prowess not by their elite romanticism, totally not being cheap like some western Knights used to mock them.

Speaking of being cheap, there was Pilek. He was a Pugilist so his weapon mostly a spiked gauntlet he bought for a few copper coins from the blacksmith uncle who lived next door--quite unexpectedly, Pugilist that usually wasn’t that popular in the job market outside the village, was quite abundant here, especially when youngsters’ thugs battle were popular, thus many created gauntlets for them resulting those simple weapons’ price dropped very cheap.

On the other hand, Polio the other Bony’s lackey was a traditional Mage who brought an old wooden staff he inherited from his father, who long retired casting spell in favor of stable life farming and fulfilling duty as the elder of a minor family in the village. The usually quiet deliquent looked like a proper mage when he equipped the old staff. Nilda, who looked even more humble in her maidservant attire, brought with her a simple-looking dagger she put in her belt--of which, secretly, was something she got from her predecessor and being imbued by high-level magic by her sect’s Artificer, a knife that being too modest of an appearance if throats cutted and blood spilt were being counted.

And finally, there was Lyla. Lyla brought a bamboo basket. A fine crafted bamboo basket, but an ordinary bamboo basket nonetheless.

“Get me some berries to feed bunnies and kitties~~ yuuhuuu~ feeding lovely bunnies and kitties~~~”

“Really, what is this girl really doing here?” Pilek uttered as he watched, while others were occupied with monsters and mountain beasts, Lyla was busy foraging the mountain, humming on some carefree song about bunnies and kitties. The previous empty basket was now filled with mushroom and berries. She didn’t even seemed to be interested in leveling up her stats.

“Don’t say anything unnecessary, remember,” Polio reminded.

And thus, they continued adventuring the mountain with such light and hearty atmosphere with Lyla’s bunny and kitty song playing in the background.

Five minutes ago, Bhela spotted a fleeing pheasant. She sprang alone with her bow in order to hunt it down. Bony, the leader of the boys, went on a different path to investigate the mountain since the air about it was quite different than the usual.

“Still, we’re climbing up to hunt some wild goats but haven’t found any for a few hours,” Pilek complained after gulping fresh water from his bamboo container.

Polio said after a thought, “Mountain goats are adept and sensitive to dangers. So maybe it’s not safe today, after all.”

“Huusshh! That girl is maybe listening!” Pilek whispered, glancing at Lyla and the maidservant Nilda who both were sat on grassy ground to eat some mountain fruits they had gathered. Pilek continued, “What if they decided to annul our job and don’t pay us?”

Polio looked at him. “Well, it depends on what Boss Bony has to say. If he’s saying it’s dangerous and we need to return back to the village, then we’re going down no matter what. If you want to keep your money then it’s our boss’s mood that you should’ve worried about.”

Bony came back and sat down with Pilek and Polio, wiping sweat on his forehead with the bottom of his shirt the first thing he did.

“How is it, boss?” Pilek asked.

Bony took a big gulp of fresh water before he replied.

“I’ve been circling around the mountain. I found nothing.”

“Nothing? That’s good. I really thought we won’t get paid today.”

“No,” Bony cut off Pilek’s sense of relief, said with an urgent tone, “it is really nothing. Except the beasts we’ve met before, I found no other beasts prowling around the mountain.”

“Is it bad?”

“It is bad.”

Bony spat his phlegm.

“We should go down. But let’s hear what that Malikh girl’s going to say first,” he said as he peered through the distance, seeing a young female silhouette hopping around on slippery steps with a pheasant carcass in her hands.

“Sis Bhela, did you find the wild mountain goats?” Lyla shouted as soon as Bhela returned.

“Yes, but they hide behind a path guarded by a big anaconda.”

Lyla gasped. A big anaconda was a big deal. Its belly was so big it can fit an adult person in it. Its presence gave a big warning thus Lyla asked worriedly, “Does that mean we won’t get to make goat satays tonight?”

Bhela patted her head. “Don’t worry. Tonight we’ll be grilling wild goat satays with Aunty Yaya and others.”

She had promised Lyla, and she didn’t plan to retract it back. So she approached Bony and others again to make a deal.

“You guys can have the anaconda. I just want a single wild goat,” Bhela said to them.

“That big anaconda you mean? The one that everyone was talking about last year? Are you crazy?” Pilek realized his tongue slipped and quickly corrected his tune. “Dear kind Young Lady Bhela, it’s not that we don’t want to help you. But against a Level 18 Anaconda, even with Boss Bony here we won’t make the cut!”

“You are wrong,” Bhela said flatly, “it’s Level 19.”

“That is even worse!”

Bhela wanted to discuss this to someone with more intellect, so she turned to Bony. “I haven’t seen any other beast that strong enough to threaten our party except for that big anaconda. There wouldn’t be any distractions. So hunting it down should be easy.”

“And you’re saying you don’t find anything wrong with not seeing any other beast except that anaconda?”

Bhela was quiet for a moment. Back when she hunted the fleeing pheasant, a masked woman came to her to tell that she ought to be careful not to approach the peak of Badril Mountain. A disturbance happened this morning; the watchers witnessed the beasts and wild animals fleeing down the mountain. Seeing the mountain dwellers running for their lives like that only meant one bad thing--Selaq.

Because Bhela had received help from women with similar masks in the past, Bhela did put the warning in her heart. “They are fleeing because Selaqs become more active than usual,” she said to Bony. “We should be fine as long as we return back before the sun sets.”

Bony looked hesitant, thus Bhela added, “Young Master Elzhier, I just want to let you know that I have other mean to bring that anaconda down. I came to you purely because I’ve received many favor from your elder sister. You must be at the tip of your level progress, so killing this anaconda should give you an opportunity to advance to the next level.”

Polio, with a sharp tone, asked her, “And how would you hunt down an anaconda that can eat people with a single maw, young lady?”

Bhela looked at him. Her gaze wasn’t exactly friendly as she replied, “Don’t get eaten.”

She turned around and returned to Lyla and Nilda. Just like her trademark expression, Bhela’s respond was cold, seemed to particularly not care about how they should take down the dangerous slithering creature that set them apart with the wild goats that Lyla wanted to grill as satays very much.

Pilek punched a floating leaves with his knuckle indignantly, spat, “She’s talking like that only because she’s in the back with her damn bow!”

A few days ago, Pilek was one of those villagers who was proud of Bhela Malikh for her talent and capability of being selected to oversea seminars. But the more he talked with her the more he recalled how unlikable this lass originally was. Somehow Pilek felt deceived by her fame and her pretty face.

Polio once again proceeded to ask the boss, Bony, “Now what do we do, boss?”

Bony was originally crossing his arms, fell to his own thought. Looking at his two lackeys, he whispered, “The last thing I want things to happen is to refund their money. That girl has Elder Shyla backing her somehow.”

Even Pilek who had his blood boiled in anger closed his mouth shut suddenly. His boss the Young Master of Elzhier Family--although of being a good-for-nothing delinquent like everybody said--was sharp, and aware of things normally people wouldn’t be aware of. Despite being the heir himself, Bony knew who he shouldn’t offend inside Elzhier Family. And naturally Pilek and Polio who followed him for years would also heard the normally friendly and sexy Elder Shyla wasn’t someone to be reckoned with.

“Anaconda then…” Polio muttered.

“That girl won’t change her mind no matter how we convince her,” Pilek wryly smiled.

“Don’t dilly dallying around. Let’s go now,” Bony said as he rested his machete on his shoulder and began to march, even though Bhela hadn’t finished eating berries with Lyla gathered.

“Please keep Lyla safe,” Bhela said to Nilda as she equipped her quiver once again.

“Don’t worry, Young Lady Bhela. Some elder sisters of mine are here to give support,” the maidservant said with a slight smile.

Bhela felt assured knowing that. She then looked at Lyla, patted her head. She said, “Lyla, there’s something I want to tell you.”

“Hmm, what is it, Sistah?”

Bhela picked one berry and put it in her mouth.

“Kittens don’t eat berries,” she said.

“What?!”

Lyla was shocked by the sudden revelation. Never would she thought that the cute kitties didn't like sweet berries she had gathered with her own hands. It was unbelievable. But what was even more unbelievable was that, a minute later, Lyla also found out bunnies don’t actually eat mushrooms--truly unbelievable!

---

The anaconda Bhela sighted was a beast feared by nearby hunters and young adventurers. Normally, if a dangerous beast appeared within the hunting routes, major families would form a subjugate team to hunt it down. Though this one was different. The problem was this big anaconda originally lived beyond the safe vicinity, so the practical Badril Village Head thought giving people warning would be far more efficient than form a posse--which often usually calling back the village’s fighters that been working outside the village. However, because the disturbance from the top of the mountain, it slithering down to more peaceful place, rendering the lower part of Badril Mountain dangerous because of it.

Young people were ambitious, especially those with talents like Bhela Malikh and Bony Elzhier. Since they were the ones who found it down here, they’d use this opportunity to hunt the anaconda themselves and leveling up in the process.

“Take this, you dumb son of a bitch! Hya hya hyaa!” Pilek’s high pitched swearing resounded across the mountain as he unleashed a flurry of infused mana punches--which deal almost no damage to the thick-skinned anaconda five times his size.

On contrary, it was actually better if Pilek didn’t blindly attacking instead. That what was Bhela thought. She was an Unique Class Archer of which she herself was confident to be able the most damage to her giant opponent, yet, due to Bony and Pilek at the front not knowing the word “holding back”, her arrows were to harass carefully instead of packing them with destructive elemental power. Clicks of tongue the only way she expressed her annoyance whenever her chance of shooting her skill disrupted by two muscleheads at the front.

Not far away from there, hidden behind the foliage and leaves of tree branch were two silhouettes, watching the unorganized party battling the anaconda. They were women in masks, one with falcon mask and the other with an owl one, both who were under Elder Shyla’s direct command to watch over Bhela and others.

“Seems like Young Lady Bhela is showing her inexperience in adapting with other party members,” the falcon mask commented.

“Young Lady Bhela wasn’t the type of person who was comfortable shouting around to people, especially boys,” the owl mask said.

“She should stick around with the Mage boy and let him yell at the two others instead.”

“Well, I don’t think that boy was the type who likes shouting, either.”

With no attacks packed with real power dealing enough damage, the anaconda didn’t seem to be cornered by the four party members--almost. It was the work of the three boys that gave a surprising good result instead.

“Those three’s teamwork is real solid. Young Master Bonithon is a good team leader. I don’t know he have this kind of talent,” the owl mask remarked.

“Of course he is. He’s the younger brother of Young Lady Ryntia, after all.”

Bony and his two lackeys attacked neither with fancy skills nor technique but solid pummelling. Only if reading their flow one could tell how good their coordination was. Bony, for example, got the deadliest attack of them all, but his attack style mostly done in short and heavy bursts that leave no chance for his opponent to defend against. But that also meant he didn’t focus on defending against counter-attacks. So this was when Pilek came in.

Pilek flurry of punches that delivered a little lighter than Bony’s machete swings, but he was steady and able to keep prolonged attacks that if ignored, could deal quite a significant damage. Pilek might’ve looked like he was jumping around like some annoying monkey, managed to avoid fatal attacks every time, but his steady assaults and his nimble agility allowed him to successfully draw the annaconda’s attention by the time Bony’s defence was at its edge. And then, by the time Pilek was short on his breath from avoiding the annacond’s giant jaw, from the back came Polio’s turn to unleash his most powerful skill, which despite many chance to use it previously, he just saved it particularly for this kind of situation.

The anaconda staggered its head up in the air by the magic force Polio shot. Its sharp eyes locked at the despicable Mage that broke part of its skin. Slithering its giant body forward, it tried to approach Polio instead bothering with the two humans that it had difficulty in dealing with. But Bony, who had recovered his balance, wouldn’t allow it to roam free. He chased from the side, completely disregarding his defense, trying to chop its giant body with his machete. Polio running in circle in the meantime.

By the time anaconda’s attention was back to Bony and Pilek again, everyone had already repositioned, back to square one, streaming attacks and gnawing the anaconda’s lifeforce little by little. The anaconda trapped in the rhythm created by Bony and his two lackeys, the beast realized these cursed humans were actually playing it around.

With this kind of teamwork, actually, only the three of them would be able to deal with the anaconda as long as they didn’t get unlucky. But things wouldn’t be smooth as they planned. Because there was Bhela in the back who was completely out of sync with their rhythm.

“Shit!”

Bony cursed as he saw the beast changed its direction toward Bhela. He and two others forgot about Bhela because they thought they already got the anaconda by its tail. They broke their own flow and chased the beast madly--even Polio gave chase with his wooden staff--as they tried to get its attention back to them. But it was futile. The anaconda was mature and thus realized the best chance it got to damage its enemy was to deal with the Archer.

Bhela saw the beast approaching her. Her gaze was straight, cold, decisive. She drew one arrow she marked beforehand from her quiver.

“Bhela, what are you doing?! Quickly run away!” Bony’s thunderous shout frustratingly bolstered through the air.

Yet Bhela hadn’t moved an inch from where she was standing. She quietly drew her bow and shot the arrow halfway between her and the anaconda. Her aim was fine up until then, but no one seemed to find her shooting this time was weird.

“You want to get eaten? Shit, Malikh Family will kill me, I shouldn’t have been accepted assigned by this crazy girl!”

At one side, two hidden masked women who were watching previously became alerted too. The one with the falcon mask took out a crossbow and began reloading it with one bolt.

“Wait,” the owl stopped her colleague from aiming the crossbow at the beast. “Look closely at what Young Lady Bhela doing,” she said, her tone was restrained, not clear whether she was conflicted or being awed.

As it turned out, Bhela had launched the third arrow. All of them aimed at the same position--an empty ground between her and the anaconda. And all of them marked by weird little flags colored with red, blue, green, and the fourth arrow, brown--all of them seemed to represented the elemental she had affinities with.

By the time the anaconda unwittingly crushed the four marked arrow with its giant body, Bhela snapped her fingers and chanted, “Explosion.”

_BOOOOOMMMM!!!_

The beast’s body sprang onto the air by the sudden fissure produced from delayed magic arrows Bhela had launched. It wriggled in dirt as it tried to extinguish the magic flame that engulfed its body. Yet it wasn’t something as easy as it seemed to be.

The flame was something Bhela made with one of her basic elemental magic arrow. It wasn’t anything lethal to the anaconda this size. But what made it terrifying was that, the moment Bhela shot another marked arrow to the flaming anaconda, the fire smoldered even bigger, almost burning the entire area if Bhela didn’t know how to control the fire with her water elemental magic arrows.

In the meantime, Bony and others stood speechlessly. They could only watched as Bhela shooting arrows like she was pouring gasoline. Seeing that there was still much arrows in her quivers, and seeing the magic arrows didn’t actually consume large enough mana, Bhela really did have a way to turn this fierce anaconda into a barbequed snake like she said when asking Bony and others to join her.

However, not even she had done shaving half of the beast’s lifeforce Bhela suddenly stopped.

She rubbed the wristband she had on her left hand as to summon a “Team Party” window. An ethereal panel floated before her, but there was nothing much in it beside the option to manage one party which she was in--which was led by Bony--and she tapped it quit.

_Bhela Malikh has left the party._

_Lyla Blackwood has left the party._

“Eh?” Pilek was surprised. “That mentally challenged girl actually is a Blackwood?!”

Bony and Polio were surprised too. They thought she would let them quit the party first as to not catching Lyla’s real identity. But Bhela just went ahead and made Lyla quit on her behalf.

Pilek mused, “Thinking about it again, it’s quite strange why Bhela’s the one who initiated the party setup; they actually want to disguise the fact that Bhela’s cousin is actually a Blackwood Family’s maidservant!”

Beside him, Polio wanted to correct his friend. “You birdbrain. Southern Mossack families have custom to grant surnames to outer family members and hardworking servants, but for foreign blood nobles--” he stopped, realized Bhela was glaring at him, then muttered, “never mind.”

Bhela came to them and said, “Now you can finish it. I don’t need the experience it drops.”

It wasn’t a problem for Bony and others if Bhela didn’t want the experience from killing a Level 19 Anaconda. The thing was, she took Lyla along with her.

Bony said, “You okay for your cousin not receiving experience at the least? She’s still Level 6 Novice after all.”

“She doesn’t need it,” Bhela replied flatly.

Pilek laughed. “Your cousin’s level is the worst I’ve seen since Shira--and you said she doesn’t need free EXP? Young Lady Bhela, are you holding a grudge against that scatterbrain cousin of yours to hold her back from getting spoon fed from doing nothing?”

Both Bony and Polio already were getting used to Pilek’s hobby to tease people. But Bhela wasn’t. She narrowed her eyes at them and said coldly, “Continue with what you’re doing. I’m going to hunt some wild goats.”

Bhela turned around and left.

As stupid as Pilek was, he did realize that Bhela was really angry. Bony said nothing and began approaching the flaming anaconda to chop it up. The atmosphere became stuck up, so Pilek smoothen it down with a series of fake coughs.

Polio patted his shoulder, with a friendly smile, he gave him an advice, “You should’ve shut your damn mouth, man.”

---

Ever since Lyla found out that bunnies and kitties didn’t actually like her mountain harvests, she accepted the reality and reorganized her plans. Instead of gathering mushrooms and berries, now Lyla decided to gather mangoes.

“Huup!” the girl exclaimed as she caught a falling mango with her bamboo basket.

Since the mango tree grew on the ownerless mountain, nobody would complain if they gathered all the ripened fruits here. Up on the tree, Nilda, despite not wearing dress for girls, able to agilely maneuvered through branch to branch. Her nimble yet light movement looked as if she spent a quite part of her younger years to train in the art of climbing trees. She didn’t even broke it when she tip-toeing upon branches that almost as thin as twigs.

“That’s it for ripen mangoes, young lady,” Nilda said as she sat on a leafless tree branch. “Everything else up here is still young and sour. Do you want them too?”

Lyla took a big bite of one juicy ripened mango. This was Honey Mangoo so it was sweeter than average mangoo. “I don’t like sour fruits,” she replied.

“But, Young Lady Lyla, have you tried eating Rujak?” Nilda then said with a mischievous smile.

“Rujak?” Lyla blinked, “what’s that?”

“You can think of Rujak as a sweet version of sambal--but for fruits!”

Lyla gasped again. Sambal for fruits?

“Quick, Nilda, quickly grab all those young mangoes!”

Seeing that Lyla was very interested in Rujak, Nilda explained what Rujak was as she moved from branch to branch picking on young mangos. Like Sambal, Rujak used chillies for its base for the heat--only all Rujak recipes were added brown sugar to make them sweet. Most popular Rujak used sweetened peanut sauce like that modified version of what they used in Satay recipes. In the end, whatever kind of Rujak they were talking about, what Rujak was about was dressing sour fruits in spicy, sweet sauce, the sacred side dish that idle aunties liked to eat whenever they gathered to gossip.

The more Nilda described it the more Lyla holding her drool. She couldn’t wait to ask Granny Litha to make her young mango Rujak with all these fruits she gathered.

_Crack!_

A noise of some twigs snapped was heard from the thick foliage behind them. Lyla turned her head, and found that there were sound of steps that was neither from her nor from Nilda. Her googly eyes peered through the obstacles. A bulky shadow could be seen through, too big for a human’s silhouette, approaching with nothing but two glimmering sharp vertical pupil eyes and the muffled low growling of a beast.

_Crack--crack…_

The beast revealed itself.

Lyla blinked again. The beast which lowered its head before her was a kitty--a big kitty, stripped fur, baring strong fangs, deadly fangs. It took awhile for Lyla to recall that a kitty this big was called with another name--tiger. Tiger was the king of the mountain. And the king of the mountain didn’t seem to come here with the intention to play.

_Shuua._

Nilda flawlessly landed just right in front of Lyla, protecting her sight from gazing through the prying eyes of the growling tiger.

“Well, quite a big fellow, aren’t you?” Nilda had the corner of her mouth raised. “I won’t take another step forward if I were you.”

The tiger stopped. From the way it hesitated it seemingly understood human speech, though common sense dictated it actually couldn’t. Seeing that the two girls before it weren’t armed enough to threaten it, the tiger then began taking another step forward.

_Whoooshh!_

The tiger yelped. Its instinctual primitive mind wasn’t fast enough to catch the reality had happened. In an instant, piercing pain stuck on its shoulder--a pain which immediately vanished as blood gushing throughout its body. The next thing it knew, its legs went wimp and it couldn’t move its body,

“See? I told you.” Nilda squatted before the paralyzed beast, taunting it with a soft pat on its head.

“Nilda,” someone called her name. Almost like feather, two shadows landed weightlessly behind her. Both figures hid their faces behind masks.

“Big sisters, Young Lady Lyla is fine,” turning her head, Nilda whispered.

The falcon mask, who had a crossbow in her hand, said also with a whisper, “The other kids are almost done with their business. They’ll come back soon. Keep an eye closely on Young Lady Lyla in case another wandering beast comes.”

“Yes,” Nilda eagerly said. “Is it okay Young Lady Lyla sees you?”

“If it’s Young Lady Lyla I don’t see any problem with it,” the masked woman replied. This wasn’t the first time Lyla saw her and the girl didn’t seem to mind too much about them, two shadow agents that specialized in covert missions. They only revealed themselves in front of Lyla only because they reckoned that the airhead Lyla was too scatterbrain to disturb their daily missions.

They didn’t notice but, Lyla, the subject in their secret conversation, had come to squat in front of the paralyzed tiger. She patted the beast’s head just like Nilda did before, but with a softer touch which invited a sad growl from the beast.

“Eh? What are you doing, Young Lady Lyla?”

By the time Nilda realized it, Lyla had already pulled out the poisoned bolt that stuck on the tiger’s shoulder and poured a whole vial of healing potion Bhela gave her before they climbed the mountain.

Nilda’s expression was complicated. She asked again, “Why are you healing this one, Young Lady Lyla? It’s dangerous. What if it attacked you?”

“It won’t,” Lyla said.

Nilda thought Lyla was being mischievous again. So she kindly reminded, “Tigers have sharp fangs,” she said, “it can eat you the moment it’s able to move.”

“No, it won’t,” Lyla said again. Her eyes glued to tiger that had giving up expression.

At first, Nilda smiled as her brain tried to look for an excuse to make Lyla stay away from the beast. But she stopped when she saw the unusual light on Lyla’s eyes--her eyes were sad, but not exactly tearful. She gazed through the beast’s eyes with a trance of pity. It was an expression that no one would expect coming from a girl who liked hopping around to sing and dance all day around.

Not long after that Bhela returned along with the boys who carried a goat’s carcass with them. Bhela thought Lyla’s cheerful singing would welcome her by the time she arrived, but the sight of a limping ferocious tiger made a visible turbulence through her face muscle.

“What happened?” Bhela asked Nilda.

“Don’t worry, Young Lady Bhela. This beast is poisoned, it can’t move--for now,” Nilda assured her.

It was not that Bhela didn’t believe her, but upon seeing Lyla’s rare expression, she knew something else was going on.

“Lyla,” Bhela squatted beside the girl, asked softly, “what happened?”

Lyla rubbed the tiger’s head as she replied, “Aunty Tiger came here to ask for help.”

The lack of usual enthusiasm in her reply made Bhela thinking about something.

“What does she want us to do?” Bhela asked again.

Lyla was silent for a moment, her fingers didn’t stop shuffling on the fur on the tiger’s forehead.

“Her child--she’s looking for her child.”

Bhela looked closely at the unmoving tiger before relied, “Then let’s help looking for her cub.”

Lyla looked at Bhela and blinked.

“Can we, really?”

“Mn.” Bhela assured with a nod.

Lyla felt happy for the tiger. She hopped around and regained her usual happy self. While she promised cheerfully to the paralyzed tiger that she and Bhela--who could do anything according to her--would help the beast to look for its cub, the latter then came to Bony and two other boys to employ them again to search for the missing cub.

“Somehow, I felt this girl paid us to be her lackeys from the start,” Pilek lamented. Beside futilely fought the anaconda only to see Bhela defeat it alone, the only meaningful job they had been doing this time was carrying a dead goat for her. She didn’t say it, but apparently Bhela wanted for paid porters, not bodyguards or party members.

Before set out to do the new task they got, Bony led his two lackeys to put the goat’s carcass below a shadowy tree. At that moment his eyes swept on the ordinary maidservant that he knew working in his family, then glanced at the pitiful tiger on the ground. He caught a striking old slashing wound on the tiger’s face. His father told him about a particular tiger that once Elzhier Family tried to subjugate, of which his father proudly claimed he succeed in slashing the beast’s face despite of failure in bringing it down. Thinking that, he looked at the maidservant again. Nilda caught him looking at her way, thus she respectfully bowed as the customary of one servant to her master. Bony turned and said nothing in the end.

“Let’s go,” Bony brought the two others away to look for one tiger cub. At least for generous payment and opportunity to raise his level, Bony could look for the young beast until the sun lowered.

In the meantime, Bhela would be going to look for the cub along with Lyla.

“Nilda, please stay here to look over the mother tiger,” Bhela said.

“You can count me on that, Young Lady Bhela.”

Lyla came to the paralyzed tiger again and put two ripened mangoes before the beast.

“Here, Aunty Tiger. You can eat these while we’re searching your kitty for you!”

Bhela wanted to say that neither tigers, bunnies nor kitties ate mangoes. But Lyla’s determined face made her hold her tongue.

The moment Nilda was alone, two silhouettes who hid their presence when the others were here, returned unapologizingly as they checked on the helpless mother tiger.

“Didn’t expect for Young Lady Lyla reacted that way, I should’ve used another bolt if I knew it will be going like this,” the falcon mask said. For the trained eyes like these masked women, they didn’t need to use magic items or particular skill to know that there was no hope for this beast. “Oh, well--” she took out a dagger, and put the tiger’s out of its misery, “--you told that young lady an excuse for this, Nilda.”

Nilda looked at the fresh blood that gushed out from the tiger’s slit throat. “I’ll say it suddenly has a fever and died.”

Standing in the back, the woman with owl mask, opened her mouth after a deep thought, “About Young Lady Lyla--do we know anything about her?”

“Young Lady Lyla?” the falcon mask stood up after wiping the blood from her dagger. “She’s from Blackwood, quite a cute girl for someone who is slow learner.” Slow learner was a polite tone to imply that for a fourteen years old girl with only Level 6 Novice was considered behind the standard, even for commoners who couldn’t afford to buy Boost Elixir in bulk like Blackwood Family was.

Though her face was hidden, it was obvious the owl masked woman had something she wanted to say.

“Sister Owl, do you have something on your mind?” Nilda asked curiously.

“Well, she’s actually was posted back in the seminars that those girls attended, so she’s quite concerned about them,” the falcon mask teased from the side.

The owl didn’t humor her partner’s teasing and instead said seriously, “I just noticed after the boys mentioned it--but I guess it’s true, something about Young Lady Bhela diberelatedly suppressed Young Lady Lyla from leveling up.” She took a beat, explaining, “I’ve seen Young Lady Bhela trained diligently and is very disciplined toward herself. But I haven’t seen her use the slightest bit of her attention to train Young Lady Lyla.”

“I think you’re overthinking it, Sister,” Nilda said sweetly. “Young Lady Lyla is very spoiled, you see. That’s because Young Lady Bhela pampered her a little bit too much.”

The one who disagreed with Nilda was the falcon mask instead. “You don’t know that she’s taking Young Lady Lyla with her out of the party before the anaconda was slain.”

The expression on Nilda’s face showed a hint of surprise. “Really?”

“It’s what really happened,” the falcon said, her voice sounded dry.

“But why Young Lady Bhela do that to her own friend?” Nilda asked.

Meanwhile, not long after they went looking for the missing cub, Bhela and Lyla found a scene that quite peculiar. On the brown mountain ground was pool of blood, gushed out from the two dead beasts that both seemed to die after fighting each other. One tiger and the other was golden fur gorilla. Both had majestic appearance which suggested the were the kind that ruled the Badril Mountain before this tragedy happened. Bhela, who felt slight dizzy from the excessive smell of blood, wanted to pull Lyla from there.

“Nuu, Sis Bhela,” Lyla struggled, then continued saying, “behind the rock, behind the rock!”

Bhela’s perception as an Unique Class Archer was enhanced and soon knew there was something moving behind the rock Lyla pointed at. When they came to check it out, immediately a tiger cub welcomed them with a lazy yawning.

“Huu… here kitty kitty kitty…”

Lyla picked up the tiger cub and hugged it dearly.

Somehow Bhela found this cub wasn’t even bothered by the ghastly scene happened nearby. She looked again at the dead tiger, and back at the cub, and concluded that the father ought to be dead defending the little one. Yet the tiger cub looked it just wanted to back to sleep, had little care with the tragedy befell it.

“Ssuuush shuuush suuushh… it’s okay kitty, it’s okay, you’ll be my little friend from now own. Sis Bhela and me will be your new sisters!”

The cub yawned again. It didn’t want to bother with this human girl speaking. It snuggled in Lyla’s bosom and slept. Only a moment later Bhela learned that the cub’s cubby body actually had slightly shaken in its slept--and only when Lyla tried very hard to pet the cub, it began to be calm again.

“Lyla, we can’t stay here after dark, so we must return back immediately if we want people to give the Father Tiger a proper burial today,” Bhela said.

They walked out of the bloody place with a new companion with them. Bhela silently looking for a striking detail of the place so that she could send people here without her guiding her. Since Lyla already said that they’d be the cub’s sisters, then it was within reason for Bhela to respect the cub’s deceased relatives.

“Ssuuusshh suuushhhh…” Lyla pet the cub in her bosom again after a muffled welp escaped the cub’s mouth. “It’s okay… it’s okay… your parents must forbid you to cry, isn’t it? Poor kitty, poor kitty… sleep sleep sleep now sleep.”

While Lyla’s whole attention was on the tiger cub, Bhela looked around to see whether a third person was there to listen to their conversation, including the masked women from the sect she was friendly with. Only after she making sure they were alone did she stopped Lyla’s steps.

“Lyla,” Bhela said, “you still remember what I told you about the voices?”

“To not anybody knows I can hear them?”

“Listen, Lyla, after we get together with the others, Nilda likely will say something to you.”

“About what?” Lyla asked to express her ignorance, but failed to hide the hint of sadness and disappointment mixed in her tone.

“Lyla…” Bhela squat to get below the Lyla’s eyes level, trying to be patient with her, “you know tigers usually are very dangerous and not uncommon for them to eat people. Sister Bhela, too, if don’t know about the voices that come to you, wouldn’t dare to take chances when it comes to your life. Our friends wanted to protect you, Lyla, they meant well. You can pout but you must not hold your anger.”

Lyla’s mind filled with fun things and fluffy stuffs. So if people didn’t try to make her listen most likely she wouldn’t retained what she heard in her airy head. So whenever Bhela wanted to make sure Lyla listened she’d look into her eyes. Eventually, Lyla relented, her shoulder dropped and a rare sigh could be heard from that mouth that she usually used to yelling and singing cheerfully.

“Why you must tell me this, Sis Bhela? I’m not the one who lost their parents.”

“You’re right,” Bhela patted the tiger cub’s head. “I know this is a very hard favor. But can you learn to forgive, little one?” While Bhela tried to explaining things to the cub, this little beast raised its head that was buried in Lyla’s bosom, took a glance at Bhela’s face, then it yawned again and sleep.

It felt weird to coax a beast that hadn’t even developed its intelligence yet. But the moment Bhela saw the relief on Lyla’s face, she knew everything worked out for the better. With the sleepy companion the had just found, Lyla and Bhela returned to regroup with others.

“You’re okay kitty?” Lyla uttered as the tiger moved in her bosom, “really, aren’t you a little big for a kitty?”

The tiger cub woke up from its sleep, maybe because it smelt its mother’s presence just nearby. A hint of teary mist formed on the corner of its eyes. Lyla bitterly smiled, immediately coaxed the little one, “It’s okay, kitty, we’re with you. We’re family now,” she said. “And since we’re family…” she mused, stopped her steps, then raised the fellow little tiger up in the air, exclaiming, “how about I give you a new name? You’re big, and you’re a kitty--how about I name you Mister Kitty?”

The cub yawned, seemed not too eager with its new name Lyla had bestowed. But the girl found it quite nice to her ears, so she decided to settle with the name. “You’re going to start a new life from now on! Let’s properly say your farewell to your parents! Come on, Mister Kitty! We need to get moving, Mister Kitty!”

Lyla excitedly repeated Mister Kitty here Mister Kitty there. She was quite pleased with the name, obviously. Yet seeing that the girl became cheerful again, Bhela didn’t have the heart to tell her that the cub was, in fact, a female.
