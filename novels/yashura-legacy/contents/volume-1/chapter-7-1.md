Blackwood Family as an aristocrat, though had their roots shallow in the southern Mossack lands, really had an impressive means of sending express news. It took merely hours for words to travel from Badril Village to their main manor--which only a merit large clans and top-tier sects would have. And the Madam of Blackwood Family received the words. She, who in spite of having a supposed meal with her honorable viscount husband, was enraged that she hurled the hot cup of tea she previously sipped onto the floor. “There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood seething in anger remembering the simple instruction she gave to her eldest son. She was beautiful, even more so when angry, which was why the previous viscount picked her as daughter-in-law despite her unchecked arrogance for many years. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in the capital!”

The steward who was waiting bowed and went away to carry out the task. He didn’t wait for viscount’s opinion or even throw a glance at him. When the Madam called the shot, everyone treated the viscount like empty air.

The madam then drank the tea a maidservant poured to cool herself down.

“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?” she asked.

“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” the tea pouring maid replied.

The madam glanced at the timid middle-aged viscount who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, said, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she’s coming on trips in the seminars only to make a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”

Although the verbal abuse was uncalled for, Viscount Blackwood maintained his eyes down to the mutton he was currently dining in.

“There's no point keeping that useless girl forever in our mansion,” Madam Blackwood talking about her other child, bored glancing at the man who was supposed to be his loving husband as far as the public knew. “Send her to that village!”

After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter--to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, she wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her.

Instead the one who received the orders were people who accompanied her. Madam Blackwood picked some people who had the smart and know-how to divide a family from the inside.

Somewhere else, in a garden full with purple colored flowers, a birthday party already went on for about two hours.

The lists of guests weren’t even attended by half, but people already leaving. If it was before people would get excited for a chance to connect with a viscount family like Blackwood. However things changed after stories about the rarely seen Blackwood’s youngest lady spread, and the guests who came today were hopeful to prove the stories merely stories. Instead they were disappointed to see that the young lady was as childish--for a lack of better word--as the rumors said her to be.

“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”

The head maid saw the young lady was bored and offered. The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork.

The utensil was beautiful, decorated with a fine degree of sculpting pattern, a piece of art, but in the end merely a decoration since the young lady didn’t bother to use it. She grabbed the cake and gobbled it in mere seconds. She even put the plate on her face and licked it clean.

“Young lady…” the head maid was awkward, but the guests who came today already seen worse that they didn’t even bother to hide their disgust of the girl’s eating habit. “Is it good?” the handmaid asked after a bout of speechlessness.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!”

The young lady verdicted that she would eat the layered cake served on the center of the party.

“Young Lady, you can’t!”

“Why can’t I?!”

“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”

“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”

“Be patient, Young Lady Lyla. You must learn the way!”

“Learn what way? Can I eat it? Nu can’t do! I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”

This shorty girl, although her feature was slump with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was said she could eat a barrel worth of potatoes within a single meal. Before the two years seminars she was virtually unknown. But now she was infamous of many things. And this useless talent to be a glutton was only one of them.

It was fortunate that before the head maid giving in to the young lady’s pout, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s words. The head maid, Aunt Jiji, listened with a nod. She turned to her young lady and passed it immediately.

“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!” Aunt Jiji was happy because this meant that she didn’t have to take care of this troublesome girl anymore.

The young lady’s ears tensed up. She forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”

“To Badril Village!”

“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”

“If Young Lady Lyla promises Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”

“Nu! That I cannot do!”

Aunt Jiji knew the young lady would change her mind.

“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home is!”

“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped.

Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but Lyla was too busy to move her hips left and right. This made the remaining guests begin whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but seeing how stupid she danced they finally understood. The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had her bum itchy. Was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act in public?

Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. The girl didn’t care. That's just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.
