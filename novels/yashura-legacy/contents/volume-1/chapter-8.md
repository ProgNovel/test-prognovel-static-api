In Badril Village, lived two friends who were as close as blood sisters. One had her posture clean, straight, noble--her spotless white face shone like a gem, and she moved as gracefully as a noble swan.

The other one had a pair of curious, big googly eyes--coupled with her svelte neck yet plump cheeks, she looked like that one cute, hyperactive village girl if she was in plain clothes.

The former one was prideful; she strived to be an excellent lady with her gifted talent. While the other girl, she had always been a playful one; the kind of girl that would slip away to play whenever left unchecked. The prideful Bhela never said it, but the playful Lyla knew that both of them were happy to be able to be together again after the seminars they attended together ended.

During their idyllic time at Badril Village, Bhela had heard the anxiety of her relatives and her allies regarding Lyla's presence. The minority were saying that Lyla, in spite of her status as a noble descent, was no more than a fodder--pretext for Butler Tim and the servants of Blackwood Family infiltrating Malikh Family. The unfortunate thing was that concern wasn't unfounded--indeed, Blackwood Family had been giving support to the opposing faction from the shadow, the tensions that previously shimmered behind the scene began to surface. Some worried it was only a matter of time it burst into conflict. Yet, contrary to her aloof appearance, Bhela regarded ties of her friendship very seriously; everyone who had warned her out of good intention left shaking their heads helplessly after finding out the plan that Bhela had in mind.

As Lyla was very excited and looking forward to exploring the fun life that Badrill Village could offer, Bhela found herself weak and wasn’t willing to let Lyla down.

After she was done with her chores, Bhela used the little spare time she had before archery training to write a single letter. This letter was to be sent to a long friend of hers, who she hadn’t met for almost ten years. The other party was always the big sister in Bhela’s heart ever since she was five.

And naturally, as Elder Jhamil’s influence was powerful enough for him to monitor the letter coming in and out in Malikh Family, he was alerted by the letter Bhela Malikh had sent.

“Oh, a letter? So she has more connections outside?” Butler Tim asked with one of his brows raised.

“It’s actually the eldest Young Lady of Elzhier Family. Ten years ago, an expert was on a journey and accidentally found out that Elzhier Family had some talent suited for her sect. She was recruited back then, everyone was talking about it for months since she was the first one of Badril Village children who went to study overseas.”

Maybe because his face showed a trace of concern, the maidservant who was waiting for Butler Tim quickly poured a cup of tea for him to ease his throat. Elder Jhamil, who was also sitting at the same table as Butler Tim, raised his empty cup toward the maidservant. He smiled as he wordlessly asked for his cup to be refilled. But the maidservant blatantly ignored him, acting as if this elder was empty air.

“Is this something that I should be careful about, hmm?” sipping his tea, Butler Tim then asked Elder Jhamil.

“N--no, from the way Elzhier Family behaved these past few years, I don’t think so.”

Butler Tim also didn’t pursue the matter any further. Even if the girl really studied in a sect somewhere in a rich western kingdom, really, what could a country bumpkin do in the city? Even those with talents, if they couldn’t keep up with the nobles whose resources were endless as the ocean, all the country bumpkin could do was step aside to make way for those with privileges.

“You’re a capable man, Elder Jhamil. I’ll be waiting for a report about the letter’s reply in a few days time.”

“Of course, Butler Tim, you can always rely on me!”

Butler Tim nodded in satisfaction.

“Good, then if nothing else, I’ll be going.”

He stood up and began to walk out from the room. The tea serving maidservant followed him in a docile manner. When no one was around, Elder Jhamil who was still in the room poured him a glass of tea, and picked the biscuit from the snack container. “Ahhh…” he sighed after he tasted how delicate the tea was after he poured milk in it. Indeed, even the life of a butler of a noble family was comfortable. Life as the most influential elder in Malikh Family couldn’t even compare.

The letter Bhela sent, at least, would take several days depending how far the recipient was. Maybe even more than a week or months. So Elder Jhamil thought to himself that he should take it easy and enjoy life as such Butler Tim demonstrated himself recently.

Never would Elder Jhamil and Butler Tim think that they were wrong. What possibly a fifteen years old girl with a bit of fame and talent could do, in the end?

Thirty minutes passed after the courir had gone with the letter. A beautiful elder of Elzhier Family came to Malikh Family. She came in bringing with her style and perfume. Following behind her was a maidservant girl wordlessly carrying a tray of food and snacks.

“Oh, ohh! Elder Sheyla, Malikh Family is honored to be graced by your presence!” Elder Jhamil immediately spouted his praise. Despite the respectful flattery, he couldn’t help himself from stopping his eyes stared at the lady’s big breasts.

“Oh, you and your tongue, Elder Jhamil!” the woman giggled charmingly. “I came here under my patriarch’s order. Yesterday, he regretted not having to prepare himself to receive the dear noble as the Village Head of Badril Village. So Elzhier Family is here to send our token of apology to the young noble miss, Lyla Blackwood!”

Originally, Elder Jhamil was excited upon hearing Elder Sheyla came visiting the family, excited both in mind and _lower_ body. However, as soon as he heard she came for the noble, Elder Jhamil began to hesitate.

“Oh, uhhh… Elder Sheyla… you see, the noble is…”

“Is Young Miss Lyla won’t receive our token of apology?” Elder Sheyla’s tone was sad, almost a whimper. Then she began to talk about something unrelated, “recently shops under my management hadn’t been doing well. If this goes on, coupled with my failure to apologize to Young Miss, maybe Patriarch Elzhier will revoke my elder title… you know, it’s very hard for a weak lady like me have a career in this patriarchal society….”

Elder Jhamil blinked. It was famous in Badril Village that Elder Sheyla had gained her status as an elder flawlessly by her own ability--yet someone like her, someone with great ability and _very big_ assets, had her own problems she struggled with.

“Haahh… I know I’m only living alone without a husband and has been… lonely,” she sighed melancholily--while not forgetting to swept her hair and “accidentally” flaunt her charm, the _big_ ones. “If only there’s someone who is reliable enough to lessen my worry…”

Her giant dose of charms were really breathtaking. Staring, Elder Jhamil found himself gulping. He then said stammeringly, “E-elder Sheyla, don’t be sad, I’m only considering that if the noble is resting or not. But, but… if you really need to apologize to dear noble… maybe I can ask whether the young noble lady is available!”

Elder Sheyla’s eyes brightened. She clapped once, then she exclaimed, “Really, Elder Jhamil, you can?”

“Of course, of course, if the noble’s being troubled then it’s all on me!” Elder Jhamil thumped his chest proudly. “Please, Elder Sheyla, please sit and drink this tea with milk and biscuits and wait as I’ll get you some good news. Please wait!”

As if he was injected with chicken blood, Elder Jhamil bolted through the Malikh Family’s compound. He wasn’t looking to ask about the noble like he promised, but he came to his son instead.

He asked his son, “Is your mother home?”

His son, the one with black-and-blue’d face, replied annoyedly, “No, she’s outside gossiping again. I saw her with her gangs before, maybe she'll be back just the sun’s about to set like usual.”

“Great!” Elder Jhamil was so happy he almost jumped. “Maybe today I’ll get a chance of my lifetime!”

Elder Jhamil was excited, so excited that he failed to notice, in Elzhier Family, Patriarch Elzhier had a headache trying his best for his shops to appeal for the noble young lady but never sent anyone to apologize directly. In fact, Patriarch Elzhier wasn’t even aware that Elder Sheyla was visiting Malikh Family.

A maidservant of Elzhier Family walked on the corridor where it was usually off limits for the outsiders. When a Malikh Family elder noticed her, she said her objective, revealing the content of the tray she held--pastries, sweet wet snacks, and a few kinds of food as gifts. She intentionally mentioned that Elder Jhamil, who was chatting happily with Elder Sheyla of Elzhier Family, already gave his consent. And just like that, this unassuming maid was able to reach the most unreachable part of Malikh Family: Bhela Malikh’s private archery field.

Bhela was training her archery when the Elzhier Family’s maidservant came. Realizing there was a visitor, Bhela put down her brows and wiped her sweaty face with a towel.

“Young Lady Bhela, we’ve received your letter. Eldest Young Lady sent me here,” the maidservant said.

Bhela came to receive the tray from the maidservant. There were two other maidservants who were waiting for Bhela, they quickly prepared the table--which usually used to lay arrows and Bhela’s bows. Pretty soon, the table was full of delicious snacks.

“This young miss, please sit down too,” Bhela asked the maidservant.

With an ambiguous smile, the maidservant replied, “Young lady, I’m only a servant.”

Bhela nodded as she understood. She only heard on the surface from big sisters who were on duty, that whenever these sect girls clothed in servant attires, then their identity would be servants regardless of the past. Many of these sisters were lively and gossipy, but to take their roles seriously Bhela only met them once or twice during the seminars.

“Do you mind if someone else joins me on the table?” Bhela asked the Elzhier Family’s maidservant.

“Please go ahead. Officially, these foods are going to be sent to Young Lady Lyla as a token of apology anyway.”

Even only glancing at the table someone like Bhela could notice some mixed foreign cuisines and biscuits on there, treats that were far more superior than the one Butler Tim gave her. And looking at them again, Bhela couldn’t help but felt familiar. Back during the travelling for the seminars, some of these were the snacks that would be waiting on her palates after she done with her training.

“Lyla! Where are you? Come here for a second,” Bhela called.

Not far away from there, from the thick foliage behind the archer field, came Lyla’s impatient cry, “Nuuu!!! I’m busy over here!”

But Bhela then said, “I’ve got croissants.”

“CROOOOISSAAANNNTTTT!!!!”

From the bushes leaped a silhouette of a girl. She bared her fangs, along with mouth leaking droll.

“CROISSANT?! DID I HEAR CROISSANTS???? WHERE?! WHERE?!!!”

Bhela waved the buttery pastry towards her.

“CROISSANT, I WANT!!!”

Lyla sprinted as if there was no tomorrow. Her face completely filled with dirt, hair tangled with leaves, leaving her dress--which was supposed to represent her noble house--completely messy and dirty.

“Which one is my share?” Lyla asked impatiently.

“You can eat how many as you want,” Bhela said.

It was dangerous for an ignorant person to utter that sentence to Lyla, but as Bhela was already a veteran in feeding Lyla with snacks and food, she of course knew what would happen next: the pastry on the tray was completely gone, stuffed inside Lyla’s mouth. Her cheeks got puffed like a nut addict squirrel.

_Om nom nom nom_.

A rabbit hopped out of bushes. It looked around, then its eyes accidentally met with the swollen cheeks Lyla’s.

“Mwister Bwaanyy!”

The rabbit’s ears shot up in alertness.

“Whwere dwo ywu want to gwo, Mwister Bwanny? Don’t rwan awway from meehhh!”

Not even she finished swallowing all the pastry she ate, Lyla already bolted again to chase the escaping rabbit. This was what happened if Lyla left unchecked, she just played and, oftentimes, suddenly rolling around on the ground for no apparent reason.

“You two, please make sure Lyla doesn’t hurt herself,” Bhela said to the maids who were serving her.

“Right away, young lady.”

That left Bhela and the maidservant from Elzhier Family. Bhela knew there was going to be a discussion where no one else was supposed to learn.

From her sleeve, the maidservant who came along with Elder Sheyla Elzhier took out a scroll. “Young Lady Bhela, please take a look at this.”

The scroll was lite. Enough to hide it easily between clothes. But the content was anything but light.

“This is…”

The first thing she read was a profile of someone named Tim Krosslugan. Born and raised in a servant family, fated to serve the Blackwood Family since childhood. The scroll contained his level of education, wealth, connections he made over the years, along with recent bribes he made or received and the name of his current lover. Bhela frowned when she recognized the name of the lover written in it.

“Butler Tim… and that maid… are having an affair?”

“Yes, the maid who always serves him a cup of tea. They were doing intercouse in regular basis. In fact, they’re doing it in a room right at this moment.”

Bhela let out a soft groan. The maid was supposed to wait for Lyla. For them to neglect their young lady to this extent, even Bhela as the host was ashamed of their behaviour.

“What would you do, young lady?” The Elzhier Family’s maidservant asked with her ambiguous voice, almost as if her tone was floating, “the intruders were disrespectful towards Malikh Family. If you read the scroll further, then you’ll see an applicable move you can make right here, right now.”

Bhela read the next section, the tea serving maidservant's name revealed. Although its content was lacking than Butler Tim’s, Bhela could see why the Elzhier Family’s maidservant recommended it. Turns out the tea serving maid’s lovers were not just Butler Tim, but some other people which one Bhela recognized--Frane Blackwood. That pompous Blackwood Family’s Young Master who was always chasing her actually had a lover who was serving another man right inside his crush’s house. The maid wasn’t exactly beautiful, but she was Frane Blackwood’s first woman, there was a record where he got repulsive due to possessiveness.

“This is disgusting,” Bhela murmured.

“You can blackmail that butler. This maid’s position is a little bit special in Young Master Blackwood’s mind.”

Bhela’s frown tightened. It wasn’t that she didn’t care about a scandal happening right in her roof, but for a maiden like her to confront scandalous adults wouldn’t be a good sight to see. She then lowered the report she was reading.

Butler Tim was distracted. The fact that Lyla could play till her legs cramped and ate till her belly was bloated like a pregnant young woman was only because Butler Tim was distracted by a woman and his own schemes. Bhela glanced at Lyla playing with the rabbit. Her eyes looked serene. Could Lyla still be this unrestrained if Bhela attacked Butler Tim directly?

The Elzhier Family’s maidservant guessed roughly what Bhela had in mind, thus she didn’t mention the affair again.

“We also have complied the activities and unethical dealing of everyone under Elder Jhamil’s wings.”

As Bhela read it further, she couldn’t help but be amazed by how detailed the report was. Some corruption cases even dated back ten years ago, back when Bhela a brat who didn’t even yet realize how evil Elder Jhamil whom she called with horrific uncle. It wasn’t that difficult to end Elder Jhamil’s career with only this. If she went down to that route, however, the major problem would be to political upheavals that would follow. Not to mention that several elders that were previously the core of the family's management under her father still couldn’t be contacted--even with her friends in Elzhier Family’s help--making direct assault on corrupt elders would be too risky to carry out.

Not to mention, her father’s condition was a little better since the ngajen ceremony, to force him to stand up from his bed and lead the family, Bhela didn’t want to see that happen.

“Have you made up your mind, young lady?”

“Yes,” Bhela said. “Please send my thanks for Sister Ryntia Elzhier’s kindness again. I’m much in her debt.”

“Eldest Young Lady is your friend, Young Lady Bhela. It’s natural for us to take care of her friend,” the Elzhier Family’s maidservant said with her head slightly bowed.

“I will write something for Sis Ryntia. I’ll promise I’ll pay the favor that I owe in the future.”

Bhela was talking about paying favors with a solemn face, the maidservant only smiled at this.

“Eldest Young Lady will be waiting. And if nothing else… then,” the maidservant laid out a purple-ish colored bottle on the table, “please carry this for your protection, Young Lady Bhela.”

Bhela studied the bottle. She couldn’t help but be confused by the sudden gesture. “May I ask… what this bottle does?”

“Does Young Lady remember yesterday’s explosion coming from Yashura Family’s area?”

Bhela blinked. Yesterday, there was indeed a commotion about an explosion coming from Yashura Family’s place. But Bhela didn’t expect that it was caused by a simple bottle like this.

“It’s our sect's finest elixir for conjuring exorcism flame. Currently, Yashura Family hosts a very… evil Nalaq. And Young Master Shira Yashura even benefited a lot from having a connection with him.”

“He does?” Bhela tightened her brow.

The maidservant nodded. “The rumors of him being a useless Level 3 Novice is already obsolete since that Nalaq gave him many good things.”

“This is unexpected,” Bhela said with a displeased tone. Having see a fair share of ugly schemes of the young nobles, Bhela believed information from people she trusted more than a fiancé she never had a conversation with. “Yashura Family had always been upright for years,” she said then, “a boy before his coming of age ceremony shouldn’t be playing too much with money unsupervised.”

“I can’t really say about Young Master Shira’s character, all I can say is that this Nalaq is a bad news. Young Lady Bhela--” the maidservant stopped as her eyes swam to assess Bhela’s charming figure, “--you’re the type that the Nalaq likely to harass.”

Bhela’s face was slightly perturbed.

The maidservant said again, “Even the Eldest Young Lady is very concerned of your safety ever since she received the news of our sisters have fallen to this Nalaq evil conducts…”

“Were the victims okay?”

“They were alright since they could escape swiftly as soon as the evil Nalaq showed himself. They’re professionals, after all.”

“Then I can only say my thanks again for your concern. I owe you twice today.”

The maid servant nodded.

“It seems I’m overstaying your grace today, young lady. My sisters need me back for a mission today,” before she turned back, the maidservant gave Bhela one last warning. “No matter what, young lady, please protect your back against that evil Nalaq.”

“My back, yes, I will take extra care of my back--”

“No, no, young lady. Your _back_. Protect it well. I mean it.”

“Okay…?” Bhela tilted her head in confusion. Did the maidservant try to warn her that the evil Nalaq would come at the most unexpected direction--that was… her back? Looking at the maidservant’s serious face, she wasn't so sure anymore.

Even after the maidservant and Elder Sheyla went back to Elzhier Family, Bhela still dazedly staring at the exorcism elixir in her hand. Around an hour after that, Lyla returned, only because her legs were tired chasing the rabbit all over the place. Bhela dazedly staring still at the elixir.

Difference between Selaq and Nalaq was that Nalaq could be reasoned with. Many Nalaqs granted security and prosperity. But to reason with evil Nalaqs just for the riches had been proven to be mistakes in the course of history.

“Yashura Family…” she murmured. Recalling a boy who was supposed to be her fiancé, her brows tightened, “having a contact with an evil Nalaq… what did he planned to do?”

---

A certain young master of the major family planned to get rich so that he had the chance to live a slow life as the Yashura Family’s patriarch in the future. Beyond that, he planned nothing.

And the supposed evil Nalaq, who brought himself by the name of Good-Natured Spirit, was basking in the sun while carelessly enjoying a painting of lady that got her bottom raised in an erotic pose. He was in the mood to appreciate women’s heavenly butts, thanks to the feisty unwanted visitors who blasted him with exorcism elixir. As a gentleman as Good-Natured was, he couldn’t get mad toward beautiful ladies--especially those with big boobs and big butts. Instead, just like any unreserved cultured gentlemen would do, he yearned to get to know them better, privately.

“Man, those girls from Big Boobed Sect likely won’t come here for a while…” Good-Natured Spirit sighed. He rolled the semi-porn painting he had and put it inside a bag, which seemed magically swallowing the painting in spite of its small size. Then he picked up the cigarette he left on top of a rock, inhaling it for all the smoke it was worth left. He then cocked his head up.

Like an enlightened monkey, Shira Yashura tangled himself upside down on a tree branch, his eyes calmly closed.

Good-Natured Spirit ground the cigarette he had against the rock. “How is it?” he asked.

“I think I’m ready to level up,” Shira said, slowly opening his eyes.

He wasn’t talking about his level as a Novice. But about a peculiar **passive skill** he got from Good-Natured Spirit, of which he won by a fair game of chess about three months ago.

Good-Natured Spirit stood up. As a Nalaq, he usually floated, yet his feet glued to the ground as if the gravity once again accepted him as a living being that had a body mass.

“Come down a sec, let me test you.” After he said that, Good-Natured Spirit stomped the earth with his right foot. Three pebbles with similar sizes jumped, floating on the air, then wrapped by the same bluish aura as the hollowing energy that shrouded the Nalaq with. He grabbed the pebbles with a sweep of his hand--they reappeared between Good-Natured Spirit’s fingers hollowly, with a trace of ethereal quality, the trait of objects that only spiritual beings like Nalaqs could interact with.

Shira, with his hairs tangled upside down by the gravity, asked with a frown, “You’re not trying to kill me, are you?”

“You’re saying you're scared of pebbles?” Good-Natured Spirit scoffed.

“You heard the saying, right?”

Good-Natured Spirit groaned. “Stop. I don’t like it when you’re being a smartass.”

“The saying goes,” Shira, closing his eyes again, said, “a single pebble could take a life if thrown by a brainless Nalaq.”

“It’s _thrown by a_ _careless person_, you little fuck,” Good-Natured Spirit scowled. “Come down here so that I can see your progress on **Water Flowing Style**.”

Shira jumped down from the tree branch with a three hundred sixty degree flip--a move which a year ago he couldn’t hope to achieve. The **Water Flowing Style** Good-Natured Spirit gave him improved his athletic instinct by a very large margin. But applied to him, a boy who’d rather use his brain than muscles, the result wasn’t that apparent if seen by untrained eyes; he never really used the skills he got from winning the bet against Good-Natured Spirit. That attitude, however, changed since he had a duel to fight with the Young Master of Blackwood Family.

“Really, I bet there’s going to be a ton of people coming to watch the duel, I need a way to get defeated in a way that won’t bring shame to Yashura Family…” he murmured.

“You’re talking about that duel? The one with that shitty face Blackgood-whut-you-call-it guy? Why defeat, though? Just smash his damn face, really, it’s easy if you wanted to.”

“It’s weird you called him ‘shitty face’, when that noble’s face resembles yours.”

“You dare say he looks like this handsome me?”

“I really thought he’s your descendant or something. Both the same--face and shamelessness alike. Bet he’s also a despicable pervert.”

Good-Natured Spirit snorted. Ignoring the impudent boy, he then came back asking him, “You can mess that Blackdood guy’s face, even if you’re a shitty Level 3 Novice. Anything is possible with the help of this Ol’ Good Natured-Spirit. This Ol’ me feeling good enough to teach you something about mysterious awesome power. Get it? A power--mysterious and awesome. Sounds cool, isn’t it? I’ll give it to you for free. Seriously, I mean it. You believe me kiddo?”

“No.”

“Ey, this is where you should reply with a ‘how?’! Really, I tell you, if you follow my lead, I can give you a power beyond the **System**.”

“Ohhh…” Shira nodded unenthusiastically. “What **System** we talking about again?”

“_The_ **System**.”

The power beyond the **System** only occured in myths. Level and Classes that had been the foundation of many orders, the systematic stats, said to be relevant and useless in front of it. Shira, as a rational young man, of course believed the possibility of this chaotic power beyond the order--but coming from this Nalaq, knowing from experience, Shira felt it was complete bullshit.

“I knew you were interested,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms, smirked, “this is a training program I made myself. I called it ‘Training of Hell’. This is where you’re acquiring a cheat-like power kiddo. Hence the cool name. Hella training in hell. By utilizing my two thousands years of experience and knowledge, atop of the hellish sessions of training where you’ll tread in situations between life and death--”

“Nope, not interested. You’re just going to beat me to my death, aren’t you?”

“I need your soul intact in order to possess you. What the fuck I’m going to do with your body if you are dead?”

“I don’t know, perhaps you’re holding a grudge after losing repeatedly in chess you brought on your own.”

Good-Natured Spirit stared with narrowed eyes.

“I don’t like it when you look like you’re being a smartass.”

Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit at that snorted. He prepared to flick his pebbles. Shira readied his stance.

But at the moment of whimsical Good-Natured Spirit decided not to flick them. He played the three peebles in his hands with the attitude like he had nothing better to do.

“Just throw them already.”

Good-Natured Spirit smirked.

_Whhoooshh!_

The Nalaq flicked one pebble with his thumb. The pebble that infused with his bluish aura bolted through the air, slowly--no, it was as swift as a flying arrow but Shira’s perception caught the projectile in a slow motion.

Something coming deep from the boy’s subconsciousness, taking over his body seamlessly, then sending command to his motoric nervous system to bend his body slightly sideways--the flying pebble shot through the space between his arm and hip.

“Next--”

The second and the third pebbles were coming. And like before, Shira avoided them in an effortless manner, moving only a mere inch more than it needed not to get hit by the Nalaq’s pebbles.

Shira only learned Good-Natured Spirit’s Water Flowing Style amateurly, but he managed to dodge the three peebles infused with the Nalaq’s aura. However, as the last pebble, Shira had to continue the Water Flowing Style’s flow; his lack of experience using the passive skill failed him to return to his stance properly--made him to spin one hundred eighty degrees backward. The boy didn’t think too much because he thought he passed the Nalaq’s lame test. It was only afterward Shira realized the Nalaq forced him to turn his back on as the fourth pebble came and knocked his head.

“Kg-uggh!” Shira hissing as he rubbed his head. “Why the hell? It's supposed to be three.”

“When did I say I’ll throw three pebbles? But this is for your own good, a’right. Do you get the moral story about the fourth pebble?”

Shira frowned.

“If you’re trying to be a smartass, you’re gonna get fucked up indefinitely.”

“You asshole.”

“Ey, is that how you’re supposed to say to a revered Nalaq?”

“You’re the one who said you’re not a Nalaq.”

“Now, now, let’s not be so hasty goin’ back a smartass again, shall we? Lest, more ‘accident’ bound to happen…”

“Ughh…” Shira was fed up dealing with this Nalaq. “Screw this. I’m going home.”

Good-Natured Spirit shrugged, then he rested his back on a tree. Shira thought a Nalaq couldn’t be more carefree than Good-Natured Spirit. From his mystic bag, Good-Natured Spirit took out a new painting that was more inappropriate than the one from before. He said to Shira, “Don’t forget to exercise your breathing, Water Flowing Style is all about your breath. Level 3 Water Flowing Style is on another whole level that Level 2. You already feel the difference, no?”

Although Good-Natured Spirit’s advice rarely did good--most turned out to be pranks, actually--this time Shira did feel the passive skill Good-Natured Spirit taught him had some sort of mysterious effect back when he dodged the Nalaq’s pebbles. Upon returning to Yashura Family, he decided to look for a Specialist who would show his **Stats Window**--the one who would do it free for him would be his cousin, Mila Yashura.

And when he came to Mila:

“Pah! How come your Wisdom goes up yet again? How many times do I have to tell you, you’ve got to have some muscles, put your effort on raising Strength and Agility!”

Yet, although it was free, it didn’t mean it wouldn’t incur any cost. If he wasn't careful Mila would nag him with full power, which depending on the weather and how the wind shifted her mood, the nagging could last half a day. Shira sighed inside his heart, if he knew Mila was on that time of the month today, he would use his own money to get his Stats checked. Only, the last time he used an outsider Specialist’s service, everyone in the village immediately knew that he was the only teen that still wasn’t better than ten years old kids.

“Where are you going?” Mila crossed her arms when seeing that Shira trying to escape.

“I haven’t done my share of today’s chores. Uncle and aunt have done so much for me… I’ll be doing my part of filial duty and do some errands right now….”

“Errands? You meant goofing around in the market?”

Shira groaned. If Mila was like this, he knew from experience that she wouldn’t let him off easily.

“Go to the field training, you’ve got to learn how to handle wooden swords,” Mila said. “Forget about errands. If you at least show even the slightest bit of motivation on preparing for your upcoming duel, then I’ll talk to my mother about exempting you on daily chores.”

“I’ve been preparing myself, though.”

“What did you do?”

“I’ve been training on this wonderful skill called Water Flowing Style from a certain… mmm… master…?”

“Why fuck you tilting your head for? What kind of stupid master was willing to train you when all you do all day was lazing around alone on the hill?”

“I wasn’t alone,” Shira said solemnly, “the Venerable Good Nalaq is always with me.”

Hearing the Nalaq was mentioned, Mila sucked the deepest breath out of her life.

Seeing that Mila subconsciously took a step backward, Shira didn’t let her off the hook. He turned his body and bowed apologetically to an empty air. “I’m very sorry about my cousin’s rude mouth, Sir Venerable Good Nalaq… she’s always dumb like this and never put any attention to her wording. Please be patient until she grows enough to have an adult’s brain.”

Mila, although usually thoughtless of the consequence of her behaviour, she wasn’t born stupid. She knew very well the result of angering a revered Nalaq. Because of that, she immediately dropped to her knees and begged for forgiveness.

“Have mercy, Sir Venerable Good Nalaq! I never thought you were so kind to bless this ignorant cousin of mine with your boundless knowledge. I’m very sorry to offend you with my uncouth mouth!”

Shira then pretended to listen to the empty air, nodding off his head. “Mm. Sir Venerable Good Nalaq said you’re the one who were stupid.”

“Yes! Yes, I’m the one who was stupid! Let me punish myself by eating dirt so that I can appease Sir Venerable Good Nalaq!”

“Eh, you don’t have to do that,” Shira could see Mila was her father’s daughter. Even though in everyday’s life their personalities were completely different, sometimes, they just naturally alike in some aspects. “Just leave me alone for now. Sir Venerable Good Nalaq said the things he bestowed upon me are secret that he doesn’t want anyone to know.”

Shira could see Mila nodded in retreat. But knowing the girl’s personality, she’d find another reason to bother him by the end of the day.

He turned, only to find out that Butler Yulong saw all that happened. The butler’s expression was ugly.

“Uhh… Yulong, I think Sir Venerable Good Nalaq…”

“Young Lady Mila acts like that because she worries about you, young master. You shouldn’t have teased her like that.”

Yulong had always been kind, the wrinkled smile he had always gave the impression of a gentle old grandpa. Butler Yulong was always been the one who responsible for his education more than his own father, who was rarely in Badril Village, and his uncle Shuro, who was taking care of him as the guardian. Therefore, whenever he got angry, Shira knew he’d better listened to him.

Around that time, not far from Badril Village, a small coach took its time journeying through the mountainous road.

The coachman was a gray-haired middle-aged man, with a magic sword on his belt, acting as the sole bodyguard for the two people inside. A mid-twenty young man was found sleeping there, while the other one, a girl around Mila’s age, was killing time by reading a lite novel.

“Hmm?” the girl found herself frowning, in spite of the novel’s content which was lighthearted romance. The man also felt a subtle change in her expression, forcing himself awake, became alert immediately. Ever since the girl made the contract with her Nalaq, her own expression wasn’t necessarily reflecting her own emotion alone.

“Something wrong, Merly?” the young man asked.

With her fingers on her chin, still frowning, the girl replied, “Mama Ross tells me this place is weirdly secure.”

The coach on the front replied instead, “Road to Badril Village is safe, young lady. A ferocious group of Road Warriors had been watching this route for about twenty years now. This is a good village.”

“Oh, for twenty years straight? Badril Village sure has some dedicated good Samaritans protecting their livelihood. I wonder if Yurrin Family would be able to employ them,” the young man pondered.

“Haha, you can ask them, young master. Don’t you say you’re about to visit a family called Yashura, today? The founder of that Road Warriors is a man named Jhuro Yashura. He's been retired for fifteen years now, but his influence lasted enough to move his gang around--that’s the kind of man this Jhuro fellow is.”

“Hoo… if that’s true, even if Teacher Staterwind doesn’t get his third student here, our journey should still be worthwhile,” the man nodded in satisfaction. As a young master from a merchant family, he long knew how precious diligent Road Warriors to secure trading routes in southern land were infested with monsters and rogue bandits.

“Merly, why are you still frowning?” he asked the girl.

“Mama Ross said… it’s not about bandits, but an ancient formation. It was set here. Strong enough to hold against bombardment of Mages’ artilleries.”

It was almost as if the venerable Nalaq said this place was going to be an upcoming place for war. The man was silent hearing that. The coach, however, was a little doubtful, but he was polite when pointing out since the other party was a girl contracted with a venerable Nalaq. “That’s weird, Young Lady Merly. We’re far away from the border, and sure there’s no fortress built around here.”

“I don’t know, Norman. Mama Ross the one who said that.”

The coach, Norman, could only nod his head if the venerable Nalaq inside Merly’s body was the one who insisted.

They arrived at Badril Village about one hour later. Because the coach was made with splendid wood, the party of Yurrin Family was mistaken as the second visiting noble. The village head even enthusiastically welcomed them. The village head was disappointed, however, after knowing the new visitors were just random kids from a rich merchant family. His apparent disappointment made a bad impression on the visitors, but the Yurrin’s party of three didn’t say anything about it. And eventually, the girl and the young man finally reunited with their teacher.

Sir Baront rent them rooms at the inn he stayed. Then they came to discuss their business in the village.

“The Nalaq in this village doesn’t want to meet with Madame Ross,” Baront Staterwind said hesitantly, afraid he offending the Nalaq who resided inside his disciple’s body, “so I think we’ll try to talk a bit more with Yashura Family. They’re the ones that host the Nalaq. Their young master likely to be soul contracted--even if not, chances are he’ll be later. I want to make him your younger brother disciple. Jerrin, Merly, I’ll ask both of you cooperate with me later.”

“I do think they take us too lightly,” Jerrin said, not with an angry tone, but weren’t exactly satisfied either. He was a Level 19 Acolyte studied under Sir Baront Staterwind for seven years, but haven’t had the luck contracted with Nalaq. His cousin Merly Yurrin, however, did contract with a high-tier Nalaq. “Even noble families received us with better treatment the moment they knew about Madame Ross.”

“Jerrin, you’ve got to understand, Yashura Family has an unidentified Nalaq living in their backyard. This concerns their livelihood--it’s understandable for them to worry more about a Nalaq that been living with them than us outsiders.”

The door knocked. Norman came to report his findings about the soon-to-be third disciple.

“I’ve compiled a few points about Young Master Yashura that I deem important, please read this.” If nothing went wrong during their visit in Yashura Family, and Mama Ross approved the Nalaq from the other side, considering their teacher’s good mood, it was very likely that Jerrin and Yurrin would receive the third younger brother to study under Blue Robe Society with them. So the coach was tasked to gather information about Shira. Although a Knight usually involved of crude fighting, duel, skirmishing, and occasional ball parties, the gray-haired man unexpectedly adept at information gathering due to his rich experience in guerilla warfare.

Reading the report, they noticed he was already engaged, which was quite an unusual practice in southern lands. Merly knew the fiancée was. She remarked that due to her promising talent and her rare Unique Class, Bhela Malikh was a celebrity during Merly’s trips in the seminars. Her mysterious backers also somehow managed to intimidate higher nobles during the seminar trips--making her one of those rare seminar attendees who could do whatever they wanted in place royal heirs and clan prodigies were like cabbages. Merly knew her from the rumors and stories her friends shared with her, but hadn’t had the chance to meet with the said person personally.

Jerrin didn’t know that, but then Sir Barront told the story about what had happened in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony. He went on to tell the story about the supposed fiancée and the cousin had a fight because some blue-blood fly came to create some misunderstanding and rumors in the village. Both of the disciples naturally formed their opinions.

“Both of you don’t have to worry. On the surface this boy’s talent can’t be considered good, but I’ve met with him already; I can say that he’s a sensible young man.”

“You’re right, Teacher Staterwind. The best talent an Acolyte of Blue Robe Society could have is to get favored by a Nalaq. Everything else is unimportant. He’s already far ahead than an uncontracted Acolyte like me in terms of talent and luck,” Jerrin said, jokingly mocked himself.

Letting Jerrin and Merly spend two hours resting in the inn, Sir Baront Staterwind then sent someone to inform Yashura Family. He knew Yashura Family was quite prepared with a banquet already, but a reminder wouldn’t hurt.

“This Yashura Family… are they living in the west or the east of the village?” Merly asked, a moment after they descended the inn’s stairs.

Sir Baront replied. “They’re on the east side. Yashura Family owns almost all the lands there. Why did you ask?”

“Mama Ross is concerned with something.”

The coach replied, “Young Lady Merly, Yashura Family is on the east side, while there are two families on the west side--Malikh and Elzhier. From what the locals said, those three major families seem to be normal.”

“Mama Ross doesn’t want us to mess with people in the west side,” Merly said, “but coming to the east, she’s not sure…”

There was nothing out of the ordinary when the party approached Yashura Family. But Merly Yurrin found herself hesitate in taking another step forward--she felt Mama Ross’s restlessness inside of her. She straightened her head. An old butler was already standing by to welcome them.

“Welcome to Yashura Family,” Yulong said as he bowed his body. “We’ve prepared a little banquet to honor dear guests, please do follow me to the family hall.”

Sir Baront and Jerrin Yurrin often travelled the southern lands, having to impose many visits to many families. They replied to the locals’ greeting rather smoothly due to experience. The coach Norman, however, saw from the back of the party the Young Lady Merly’s figure consciously avoiding the butler. The coachman kept his finding to himself. In addition, he saw the butler realized the awkward gesture too, but Norman thought nothing of it.

---

For families of the southern Mossack that always throw hearty feasts for whichever reasons they could come up with, serving beef on the table could be considered grand and lavish. Yashura Family were bigger ranchers than Elzhier and Malikh Family combined, and they had the biggest plots of land in Badril Village, yet, a family this big, would only butcher cows only if the harvests of their rice paddies and other fields were abundant. But today Yashura Family spared no effort to cook the best rendang and beef stews to entertain Sir Baront Staterwind and his disciples.

Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t sleep all night just to prepare his best rendang for the guests. He put his soul as he slowly poured coconut milk over the cooking beef, giving all of his concentration to create a rendang that was even better than all the rendang he made his entire life, combined. Wiping his brows, he looked toward the clear sky. He prayed and wished for three things; for his Yashura Family could send their heir to study overseas like the young ladies from Elzhier and Malikh Family had; second, he hoped that there weren’t going to be an accident worse than yesterday's explosion would happen today; third and most importantly, he hoped his rendang would cook perfectly tender with the perfect balance of taste by the time the guests come the the family. It’d be a sign of great luck if both the sauce dried enough and the meat become tender at the same, which was usually not the case when cooking rendang.

The patriarch sighed. He was a hardcore Mossack to the bone. When his family’s fate hung upon a thin thread, he believed a good talk and good food would solve any problem in the world.

In the family hall of Yashura Family, that afternoon.

Yashura Family welcomed the guests with a banquet, the Mossack way. Plates and bowls full of exotic traditional foods were grouped and stacked on the floor, while the host and the guests would sit cross-legged in a circle. Even though Yashura Family was big, to show the sincerity of the host and to avoid the political atmosphere, for this occasion Patriarch Shuro decided the ones that humor the guests were only his close family--him, his wife, his sole daughter, and his nephew, Shira. Sir Barront Staterwind sat cross-legged on the opposite side, with his two disciples sat each beside him, and a servant gray-haired middle-aged man sat calmly behind them.

Jerrin Yurrin, the older one, was originally an extravert, the kind that could always conjure a conversion out of the trivialest things. So he drove the light talks around bountiful southern harvests and foods, a kind of talk that Patriarch Shuro particularly fond of. Besides learning about the designated third disciple, Jerrin and Merly also unexpectedly learned a lot about coconuts, thanks to Patriarch Shuro’s passionate and needlessly deep knowledge in this field. Occasionally he and Patriarch Shuro and Sir Baront Staterwind would have a good laugh, highlighting the festive mood.

In the meantime, however, Shira didn’t see the supposed high status Nalaq. Either Sir Barront and his disciples didn’t plan to engage seriously this afternoon, or the mysterious Nalaq sat back with a wait and see attitude, but all this made Shira couldn’t help but think that the prospect for him to study with these folks wasn’t as sweet as his uncle Patriarch Shuro previously believed. The only thing he noticed was the youngest member of the guests, the girl who called Merly Yurrin, was staring at him rudely.

“I have a question for you,” Merly Yurrin for the first time talked to Shira. The older folks who were enjoying a hearty chat then stopped, they focused their attention to the girl.

Shira said, “What questions do you have for me, Young Lady Yurrin? I’ll answer the best I could.”

“Is it true that you are engaged to Bhela with the surname of Malikh?”

“Oh,” the boy was taken aback a little bit. Since the other party asked about this topic, surely they knew about the ruckus that happened during Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony. “The whole thing was planned before even I could barely talk.”

“Ehem,” Patriarch Shuro cleared his phlegm, as he always knew this nephew of his always being too blunt whenever the topic of his engagement was brought out of the blue. “Young Lady Yurrin, the thing is, Shira’s father and the patriarch of Malikh Family were as close as brothers, so when they each had a baby boy and a baby girl, they thought it was a good idea for Yashura and Malikh to be together.” The patriarch saw his well-thought explanation wasn’t received well, thus awkwardly added, “That’s how it is, really. The engagement actually wasn’t a big deal before Patriarch Malikh’s daughter got chosen as a candidate to attend fancy seminars backed by lots of royal families and big clans. But now everyone seems to talk about it everywhere. Too many jealous people, so best to not taking what people say seriously.”

“I did attend the fancy seminars you’re talking about, Patriarch Yashura,” Merly said, her tone was a bit sour. “I reckon everyone in this village knows her real worth by now. Even during the seminars, Bhela Malikh is a celebrity amongst the students. She has a real talent and she always worked hard to back it up.”

Shira smiled. He smiled not because he was in a good mood. Whenever that annoying topic came up, faking a smile was the only thing he could do.

“Honestly, I balked at how sloppy your current talent is,” Merly continued, “even if a boy coming from a very poor family, at least getting to Level 6 at your age isn’t really a problem. But you, a healthy fifteen years old, who is the heir of the village’s major family, is unable to even ascend to a mere Level 4 Novice--honestly, honestly…”

Merly took out a scroll from her sleeve. The Yashura Family wasn’t too surprised for the guests to investigate Shira, but when it was mentioned blatantly they felt like they wanted to smack the boy’s head for making the family lose their face.

“I don’t know what to say about this,” Merly sighed. “Your **Wisdom** far outweighs your other attributes. People say Stats only are numbers when it comes to the realm of men and earth, and I think they have one thing correct about a high number of **Wisdom** doesn’t actually mean the person is wise. Not in this case, anyway. Have you ever considered how your position of an heir and a fiancé of well-known best talent of this generation? Coarse attributes like **Strength** and **Agility **are the easiest to raise, and the most effective way to level up--yet, after seeing your current **Stats** is, even the most ignorant one can see that you didn’t even try.”

The room fell silent. Patriarch Shuro Yashura opened his mouth, but closed before he made a sound. Even Mila, the one that first to defend her cousin during Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony, lowered her head, feeling embarrassed herself--Merly did poked at the right wound.

Naturally Shira was also silent. He knew if he opened his mouth now, the only thing that he could say only lame excuses.

In the end, it was Patriarch Shuro’s wife who opened her mouth and explained, “This… Young Lady Yurrin… it’s not like nephew Shira is too lazy to bother about it…”

“Cough, he is, a bit… cough…” Patriarch Shuro, who felt guilty about lying, murmured between his fake cough. His wife elbowed from the side, the patriarch then acted as if he didn’t say anything.

“Ever since Shira’s a baby he’s a bit too sensitive and can easily get sick,” Madam Yashura continued explaining for her nephew. “His mother left him the moment he was born, and at the time he couldn’t drink milk from wet nurses. There was an old doctor who Shira’s father brought from outside the village that always checked on him, and he said to stabilize Shira’s condition he needed to suppress his manasphere from being active--thus, his talent growth over the years hasn’t been very satisfying.” Madam Yashura sighed. She played the pitiful card since any other options already sealed. “Remembering back all those years ago, honestly, it’s already a blessing that he’s still able to keep his life. His father doesn’t even have the heart to force him taking up a sword like him. He was pitiful, this kid…”

Shira unfortunately sat beside his aunt. So he couldn’t avoid getting his hair ruffled by his sobbing aunt.

On the other side, Merly was silent as if she was pondering, and Sir Barront quickly assured the family that Blue Robe Society regarded the contract with Nalaq more important than the students’ own talents. Jerrin, however, quietly glanced back from his shoulder, asking to verify the story from the person who had personally investigated the boy; Norman nodded his head telling something like that really did happen.

At this point, Shira knew his chances of being accepted as Sir Baront’s disciple were already screwed.

A moment later, Merly continued with her sharp words as if she was numb to the awkward atmosphere. “Is this boy really have a disability?”

Shira said nothing. Patriarch Shuro timidly almost said no, but Madam Yashura hurriedly cried, “Yes! Back then, but he’s fine now.”

Merly looked at Shira. It was not known from her gaze that she was feeling doubt, suspicion, affirmation, or anything at all. She then said, “Any Nalaq won’t choose any human without any redeeming quality to contract with. That is because the Nalaq will possess him after the contract ends, and will live in the human’s place until the mortal body rots. I’m not a magician. But I have an outstanding affinity with fire elemental, enough to ensure me achieving Rank-3 Fire Mage in the future; yet that only gives me 60 years worth of contract with my Nalaq, Mama Ross. Mama Ross happened to be a great Fire Mage herself in the past,” Merly took a beat, looking straight at Shira’s eyes. “Surely, the Nalaq of yours sees something different in you that interested him. If you can convince us what’s so good about you, maybe Mama Ross will favor you a bit when she confronts this Nalaq.”

She was talking at him like he was some snotty kid, Shira didn’t like this girl’s tone. But he decided to reply to her since he wanted to save some face for his uncle.

“Well…” Shira murmured.

“Well?”

“Maybe it’s because…” the only desire Good-Natured Spirit ever showed was worldly vulgar desire of women. Shira’s mind was thinking fast; Good-Natured Spirit was a ghost, so he couldn’t touch women unless he got a mortal body. Yet, a mere body wouldn’t make a womanizer Nalaq so desperate he was willing to lose again and again waging countless games of chess. There ought something that made Good-Natured Spirit desperate to get him, and it had something to do with getting women with the mortal body of his. Finally, he reached a conclusion. “Maybe because I’m handsome?”

_“COUGH!”_ Mila loudly faked a cough.

Her father and mother coughs followed suit.

_“Cough cough cough!”_

_“Cough cough!”_

_“COUGH COUGH COUGH!!!”_

It was unfortunate that no matter how loud they were coughing, the panicked family of three couldn’t cancel the guests from hearing Shira’s reply.

Merly expressionessly said, “Your confidence is too much. You should’ve looked yourself in front of a mirror.”

Shira groaned in his heart. It was probably true that in the village popular young men like Bony were more handsome than him but supposedly his face wasn’t that bad, either. He had enough of this rude girl. Previously he wasn’t this fed up when she stood in front of that unlikable young noble of Blackwood Family. For southern people, being taken lightly as a host was horrible, it was a common sense for Mossack descents scowled at ungrateful guests. This must be how Bhela Malikh felt when Mila brazenly asked her to a duel in her own courtyard.

Frowning, Shira then said with an impatient tone, “That was the only plausible answer I could give you based on my understanding of his personality. If you really wanted to know his reason too much, why don’t you go ask him yourself?”

“S-Shira!” Mila cried. She looked at her parents; her mother’s face looked distressed, her mother looked pale. Patriarch Shuro even decided to be silent, pretending as if he was a block of wood. This family was even made speechless by Shira’s brazenness.

Merly said slowly as her eyes still locked on the youth, “This settles it. The one that approaches you isn’t a proper Nalaq--he isn’t even a low-ranked one.”

Shira raised his eyebrows.

“If it was a proper Nalaq,” Merly continued, her voice weirdly changed texture into a mature woman, “then you should’ve realized you’re talking to another one by now.”

After Merly said that, she lowered her head, closing her eyes, seemingly fell into a sudden slumber. Mystical smoke puffed out behind her back, slowly condensed into an ethereal womanly figure. A face formed, she was exceedingly beautiful, and she was frowning; she had the same scornful gaze at Shira Yashura.

“Greeting, Venerable Madame Ross!” Sir Barront Staterwind was the first one to give his greeting. Jerrin also turned to face Mama Ross and began prostrating.

Seeing the guests reaction, Patriarch Shuro who already gave up his hope on his nephew’s prospect was startled. It took a beat for him to realize his nephew had done much more damage than screwing his chance of being accepted as Sir Barront’s disciple.

“I am very sorry for my nephew’s impudence, Venerable Madame Nalaq!” Patriarch Shuro cried as soon as he slammed his forehead upon the mat covered floor, prostrating submissively. “Please don’t punish my ignorant nephew, if you wanted to punish someone then please punish this old me!”

“No!” beside him, his daughter Mila Yashura slammed her forehead harder. “My father done no wrong! It was me who failed to guide my younger cousin even though I have the chances to do so! It was me! It was me who was responsible! Please punish just me!”

Patriarch Shuro raised his head in disbelief; tears welled in his eyes as he gazed at the prostrating figure of his stubborn daughter. “Mila… what are you saying?” his voice was trembling, “the responsibility for guiding a youngster falls to his own parents and guardians only… you’ve done no wrong, daughter…”

He was touched. Although this girl called him a moron almost every single day, today’s gesture showed that she actually had a slightest bit of care for him--her own blood father.

Therefore, his eyes shot straight and filled with absolute determination; he was a father, an uncle, and the sole patriarch of Yashura Family. He decided to be a man. He decided to hold himself responsible.

BAM!

“I’m the one who was wrong!” Patriarch Shuro cried so loud that his voice echoed inside the family hall. “Please punish me as you see fit!”

As his forehead kissed the floor mat, Patriarch Shuro closed his eyes, waiting for the hammer of punishment descend upon him. However--

BAAM!

Mila’s cry shrieked even louder than her father’s. “My father is brainless! The only knowledge he ever bestowed upon my ignorant cousin is useless trivia about damned coconuts! He’s not fit to guide anyone! It was me who was supposed to guide Shira! But I failed! So please punish me!”

BAAAMM!!

“No, punish me!” Patriarch Shuro urged.

BAAM!

“No, me!” Mila cried.

BAMM!!!

“My daughter is confused, I’m the one who’s wrong!”

BAAM!

“Confused is better than being stupid! You’ll feel better if you just punish me than a moron like him!”

Beside the ceaseless yelling, Madam Yashura also prostrated with her body trembling. Shira, however, wasn’t shaking though he too followed the family of three to prostrate in front of the lady Nalaq

Mama Ross originally didn’t care about this Yashura Family. But after seeing blood trickled on Mila’s forehead, Mama Ross sighed. The girl was the same age as her Merly Yurrin. She couldn’t watch this stupid scene any longer.

Thus, with a wave of her hand, she said, “Stop! I don’t plan to punish anyone.”

Slowly, both Patriarch Shuro and Mila raised their heads, peeking nervously at Mama Ross’s mood.

“It’s okay if Madame Ross said so,” in the end, it was Sir Baront’s words that made the pair father and daughter at ease.

Mama Ross said, “When I’m still alive, the Mossack chiefs all had self-respect and would never beg others to punish themselves. I don’t know what has happened in these two thousand years, time sure regresses men’s nature. You acted like a clown.”

“I’m ashamed of my immature conduct,” Patriarch Shuro said, with his head lowered and his voice almost whimpering like a guilty puppy, “please do forgive this unworthy descendant of Mossack people…”

“Stop that self-mockery. I don’t want to hear it anymore,” Mama Ross rebuked him. She then looked at the other members of Yashura Family who were still prostrating on the floor. “More important… lift your heads, all of you.”

Shira and his aunt raised their heads.

Mama Ross said to Shira, “I see how awkward you are, child. You’re not familiar with greeting a Nalaq. That’s more evident for Staterwind’s wrong about the Nalaq with you is a low-ranked one, not to mention the fact that he’s afraid of meeting a proper high-ranked Nalaq like me. Just look how brazen his eyes are.”

The Yashura Family side were wordlessly accepting Mama Ross’s words. Shira was lazy and brazen, for that everyone in the family already knew. It was just because he was always living alone in his house that Yashura Family mainly left him be.

But to be brazen in front of a Nalaq… could be this the old saying of courting his own death?

Sir Barront Staterwind immediately said to Yashura Family, “Madame Ross is one of the pillars that oversaw Tiramikal Continent’s rebuilding after the Great Rebellion two thousands years ago--so she cares for common people greatly. Sir Patriarch Yashura, naturally Venerable Madame Nalaq wouldn’t be so petty before the ignorant folks like you!”

As if it was a competition, Patriarch Shuro and his daughter Mila threw their into the floor and yelled both at the same time, “Thank you very much, Venerable Madame Ross!”

Shira and his aunt followed after, but their responses weren’t as excited as the pair of father and daughter.

Merly was swaying in her sitting posture, Mama Ross then hugged her onto her chest. The lady Nalaq accepted the Yashura Family’s gratefulness with only a glance in the corner of her eyes--the scene of an ethereal spirit holding a girl dearly seemed picturesque, leaving the onlookers felt a hint of warmness inside them. Shira remembered Good-Natured Spirit said that for him to touch living required procedure that was so bothersome that rarely a spirit would bother to do that. Seeing that the lady Nalaq before him stroking her girl’s hair meant that she really liked this girl called Merly Yurrin.

“It seems Merly’s body still hasn’t adapted with temporary possession,” Mama Ross murmured, then she said without turning her eyes away from the girl, “Jerrin, you look somewhere for us to do combat training, this village must have somewhere good for us to train our sync.”

“Yes, Madame Ross,” Jerrin Yurrin eagerly replied. Although he was supposed to be Merly’s elder disciple and her older cousin, in reality, all he was doing these past month was accompanying and taking care of Merly while she adapted with Mama Ross’s temporary possession--a technique of which developed quite sophisticatedly by Blue Robe Society.

“Staterwind, Norman.”

“Yes, Madame Ross?” Sir Barront and the coach and bodyguard for the Yurrins waited for the order.

“That rogue Nalaq must’ve been hiding now that I can’t feel his presence. Go look for his whereabouts!”

“Yes!!”

Patriarch Shuro and his family felt nervous when he witnessed how decisive it looked when the lady Nalaq gave her orders. Especially the patriarch, although his looks seemed fierce like he was long engaged in banditry, this man couldn’t keep his calm and felt groveling on his knees was the more right thing to do.

“Umm…” Only Shira who looked awkward, like he had something to say.

“What is it, boy?” Mama Ross asked sharply as her hands patting Merly’s head.

“I think that rogue Nalaq will meet you… Venerable Madame Ross…”

“Oh? I’m being told that Nalaq doesn’t want to see me. What makes you think differently?”

“Maybe Young Master Yashura began to see Madame Ross’s greatness,” Sir Baront Staterwind musing on the side.

“Yes, after seeing you now I’m sure that rogue Nalaq will be awed by Madame Ross’s greatness.”

Shira lifted his head slightly, stealing a glance with a covertly manner. He didn’t see clearly before since afraid he would be rude to the other party. But now, he could see the picture of a girl comfortably resting her head on two great melon pillows.

After they had lunch together they decided to take a break from the meeting. After vaguely praising the lady Nalaq for her big, great assets, Shira was tasked to fetch for Good-Natured and see if he could make the two Nalaq meet. The boy didn’t search him for too long since he was familiar with the spots where the Nalaq hung out alone to smoke his cigarettes.

“Good-For-Nothing Spirit.”

“Yo, what’s up, kiddo?”

“The Nalaq I told you is in the family, now. She said she wants to meet you.”

Good-Natured Spirit sneered. “Is this a high-ranking Nalaq you’re talking about?”

“She said you’re a rogue Nalaq.”

“Fuck no, no,” Good-Natured Spirit waved his hand, saying, “I don’t believe any this Nalaq worshipping bullshit. Anyone who calls themselves _proper_ Nalaq is dead idiots with superiority complex who think they’re better because their names appeared in some fucking history books that practically no one read--the picture of you ignorant people grovelling everytime a Nalaq shows themselves is a puke-worthy sight to see. Fuck. Don’t count me for this nonsense man. I’m outta here.”

He stood up and began to float away.

It seemed Good-Natured Spirit didn’t really like his kind. But Shira already made a promise bringing him in front of Mama Ross; as the young master of Yashura Family, how could he bail on his own words now?

Shira’s expression thus became solemn.

He said, “She’s got melons.”

Good-Natured Spirit slowing down.

“She’s got big boobs and big butts,” Shira said again.

Good-Natured Spirit changed his course a total one-hundred-eighty degrees. “The fuck you’re dilly-dallying about? A fine lady’s waiting. Lead the way!”
