Bhela came back after taking care of her parents, finding out that, Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had found their appetite and joined Sir Baront Staterwind eating light dishes. Meanwhile Baront Staterwind had finished the banana leaves feast himself. He had been waiting for Bhela to come back, wanting to let her know that he didn’t plan to impose on her hospitality any longer.

From observing the guests attitude Bhela already knew by now that Baront Staterwind wasn’t interested in the discussion on her future scholarship. The girl invited him because his sect was the closest, if not the best suited, and because she calculated the man’s fondness of travelling could give her some weight if the man had a good impression of her family. After all, leaving an esteemed guest satisfied with own feast was an honor for the Mossacks--there was nothing to lose to receive a good grace from a man of Sir Baront Staterwind’s calibre in the future. Thus, with a respectful manner, Bhela offered to walk him out to the gate, though the man himself refused. He said that the two others couldn’t wait any longer and told the girl he was fine for one of the aunties that brought the dishes to do that for him.

Yet, just as he was about to stand up, an irritated voice crashed in the room, announcing pompously, “I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!”

A stride that exude cockiness emerged from the manner Young Master Blackwood entering the room. Sir Baront Staterwind laughed, but the two other guests Mamade Sylvia and Mister Harrington didn’t find the pompous entrance to be funny, furrowing their brows instead.

“What do we have here?” Young Master Frane Blackwood helped himself and sat. Two others that followed him, Elder Jhamil’s son and an adjutant who came with him travelling, also sat behind him. “Young Lady Bhela, I believe I’ve asked for your time tonight. But how come you don’t send someone to get me here?”

Bhela looked at three uninvited guests, frowning, not wanting them to be here.

“Does Bhela Malikh invite you too?” Madame Sylvia asked Young Master Blackwood.

“Of course,” it was Elder Jhamil’s son--with face black and blue still fresh from getting beaten by Bony and company, the one who replied in the young noble’s stead. “The entire Malikh Family invite Young Master Blackwood. Instead, we don’t remember inviting you people to our family’s ceremony--who the hell are you people?”

Madame Sylvia ignored him and turned to Bhela instead, repeating the same question.

“Bhela, girl, did you invite him to our discussion?”

Bhela shook her head. But the party mentioned was shameless so it didn’t matter whether she invited him or not.

Elder Jhamil’s son scoffed. He was originally someone with an ugly temper. With his face turned black and blue after those Bony’s brats gave him good punches, his temper grew even worse. He didn’t like the middle-aged woman frowning at him. He said, “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Is young noble of Blackwood Family the same as unknown commoners? Why this ignorant woman keep asking the obvious? Of course a young noble is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”

“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman frowned.

“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”

“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”

_Zziiing!_

With a flashing draw of metallic dagger, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blew up.

“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who had trouble holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home? You commoner don’t even know what etiquette is! Shameless!”

Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and clicked his tongue. One look at the dagger in the woman’s hand he knew that it was a magic weapon inaccessible to mere commonners. He sneered at Elder Jhamil’s son who lead him the way here and shouted, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”

“Right away,” the adjutant behind said. Then without hesitation he dragged Elder Jhamil’s son who was panically screaming “wait-wait-wait” out of the room.

“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime term of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipment, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine! Why don’t we have further discussion privately, only both of us alone?”

“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave even Mister Harrington a cold chuckle. Him and Madame Sylvia hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the most obvious way to bind her in for good was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefit” so brazenly.

“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.

Madame Sylvia nodded. She put the dagger she used to intimidate back and returned to fan her face, looked at Young Master Blackwood, snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people would only be able to spout honey traps to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because of your father’s situation.”

“Thank you for the advice…”

Seeing that Bhela readily accepted her advice made Young Master Blackwood itched to argue with this lady. But he held himself back because it’d be a foolish thing to do when he wasn’t even aware the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smile elegantly as a proper noble as he was. It was easier to bluff this way.

“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.

Mister Harrington looked at him, said, “Oh, we’ve reached our conclusion alright.”

Young Master Blackwood’s expression wasn’t good hearing that. He asked Bhela, “Which one managed to recruit you?” before getting a reply, he quickly added to his words, “study abroad is not the same as attending continuous seminars, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to join in school with people you’re familiar with--for example, Aged Oak School is the place I’m in right now! We’re very friendly with the school’s management. We’ll help you to the very end. One word from us Blackwood Family and you’ll have a great future in Aged Oak School!”

Bhela glanced at the young noble lazily. “Would Lyla have a great future in that Aged Oak School too?”

Hearing that Bhela unexpectedly mentioned his sister, Young Master Blackwood got his tongue tied.

“This… Lyla still below their admittance age requirement so…”

Bhela didn’t look at the young noble anymore. She had a tie with Blackwood Family and thus knew more or less the degree on how credible their words are. But Blackwood Family’s offer wasn’t important for now. The two guests’ sects were. Just from looking she knew Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their discussion when she was absent. Obviously they wouldn’t say it in front of third wheels like Young Master Blackwood.

“I’m but a clueless westerner lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said with a hint of sarcasm, obviously directed toward the young western noble man. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We didn't know our talks would turn out to be dragged this late. For this I have to annoy you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”

“I’m honored if Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington feel adequate staying in our humble abode.”

And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”

Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”

“How about me?”

Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”

Hearing her cold, yet slightly softer than the usual voice, Young Master Blackwood then understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.

Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came inside the hall.

“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.

The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”

“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela to have a “discussion”, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?

Absolutely not!

“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important matter with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”

“Y-young master--”

“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”

The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.

In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him think a lot of things. Slowly, he started getting horny.

“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”

If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participated in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never befriended any.

Because of that, he was willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. Thirty minutes later, waiting, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Finally, after Young Master Frane Blackwood waiting for three hours alone in the room, the door finally opened…

“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.

“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.

“Y-young master… let’s just get back to the inn….”

“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”

“She is in her room…”

“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.

“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”

“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”

The adjutant gulped before he replied.

“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”

So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to the inn.

A dancing lit torch in spite of gusts of the wind, a howling wolf in the distance, came to give the midnight a mood of apathetic feeling--quite a contrast air compared to the happy festive over the ceremony just a few hours ago. There were abundant stories from the dangerous days of monsters were rampant Badril Village, resulting in the unspoken taboo of not mingling around after midnight. Only a few pairs of men doing the traditional patrol “ronda” would occasionally be heard chatting away while watching out for thieves. Yet almost as if it was a normal matter, a small tea shop, would stubbornly open till five in the morning, selling teas and snacks--and, hidden from the menu, tuaq. It wasn’t well-known but for those who knew it always wondered whether the overtime really that worth it. Tonight was luckier than usual, though, as an eastern man willing to drink glasses of tea and pay money, which would be the first one to come by midnight these past two weeks.

Almost half an hour since the first customer of the week came, the second customer then arrived.

“Give me a glass of tuaq, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy features when his face was exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”

The eastern man was Kurusiya. He didn’t reply. Instead, he sipped his tea.

Sir Baront Staterwind laughed at his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.

“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father?” Baront Staterwind asked.

“I did.”

“They told me you only talk with acquaintances you met in Malikh Family, though.”

Kurusiya glanced at him. “Someone told you that?”

“Some aunties. Aunties loved gossip, you know.”

“No, I don’t know.”

Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged at Kurusiya’s grunting dismissal. It then made the mood awkward. Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.

“The two others Bhela invited stayed over there. It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were a couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”

“Maybe they don’t want to pay a abyssal price for Elzhier Family’s inn rooms,” Kurusiya uttered. Obviously his voice slightly higher meant to mock some third-party.

The shopkeeper hearing it butted in with a half-joking tone, “That is what you say, Kurusiya. But you rather stay in our family’s inn than Yashura’s smelly place.”

Sir Baront Staterwind was intrigued seeing the shopkeeper actually knew Kurusiya. The shopkeeper’s face was buried in wrinkles, his hair already whitened, this would make an unassuming passerby to never suspect the shopkeeper and Kurusiya--the man who looked at least twenty years younger--actually came from the same generation. What he found more interesting though that what the aunties told him earlier, that Kurusiya was affiliated with Yashura Family, but instead rented a room in an inn managed by Yashura’s rival family, the Elzhier. The more he knew the inside story the more she wanted to gossip. “You are an Elzhier, shopkeeper.”

“This I am,” the shopkeeper was professional, he knew the glint on the customer’s eyes meant business. So he told his story, “Back when Kurusiya still a refugee and the previous Patriarch Yashura hadn’t taken him in, this old me and other guys taught him a lot about hunting! This one is a lousy hunter, let me tell you… him getting picked up by the previous Patriarch Yashura just merely him being lucky.”

“My blade is not meant to cut beasts,” Kurusiya said sharply, “it is meant to cut people.”

The shopkeeper sneered. “You can’t eat human meat, my man. Just admit even someone like you were pretty lame back in the day.”

“Ohh,” Sir Baront Staterwind was amused. Kurusiya was too lazy to retort and continued sipping his tea.

Sir Baront Staterwind looked at the cheerful shopkeeper. Annoyingly, the shopkeeper uninvitedly came to tell more stories about Kurusiya’s dark pasts. After quite a while gossiping about the quiet but eventually grumbling Kurusiya, Sir Baront Staterwind then out of nowhere he shot a question.

“Shopkeeper, does this village has a Nalaq guarding the land around?”

“No, we don’t have a Nalaq, but we do use feral Selaqs to keep monster swarms at bay,” the shopkeeper said.

“Oh, the Ngajen Ceremony.” Sir Barent Staterwind nodded. He was, in fact, very impressed when he found out the true nature of Ngajen Ceremony.

“Yes, the ceremony meant for Selaqs to do that,” the shopkeeper said as he wiped a wooden mug with a clean tablecloth. He didn’t want to elaborate on that because the current Ngajen Ceremony was the achievement of his family’s rival Yashura Family from the previous generation. So he changed the topic instead, “Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas?”

“I won’t call it overseas, but my school is quite far away from here.”

“You are foreigner expert then!” the shopkeeper's eyes were shining. “Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing foreigner expert too, mister, an expert from purple something sect!”

“Oho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.

But Sir Kurusiya wasn’t interested in their conversation before but hearing the name of the sect he coldly quipped, “Purple Garden Sect is located on the other side of the continent. Are you sure someone from that kind of place would be so idle to pass around this unknown village?”

“Eh? I was just joking, you know--never say never.” Sir Baront clicked his tongue. “Did your Young Lady went to Purple Garden Sect, shopkeeper?”

“This… I’m not sure…” Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, when back in the village Elzhier Family was eager to see their young lady’s achievement, all she was talking about in the letters she sent were about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuff that usually young women her age were excited about. Don’t even talk about achievement, Elzhier’s eldest Young Lady had already become a city girl before everyone realized. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, found it difficult to still boast his daughter’s status after ten years of her spending overseas. So after a few years nobody really cared about it enough to even remember where she gone studying.

Thus, in his defence, the shopkeeper argued, “But still, expert, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”

“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed the blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, he admired these kinds of the simpleness of rural locals.

The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”

Kurusiya quipped again from the side, “Oh, quit it, will you? You’re sounding so pathetic the more you open your mouth.”

“Kurusiya, you…” not knowing what words to retort with, the shopkeeper then decided to tell Sir Baront stories about how Kurusiya got rejected by a maid from Elzhier Family.

After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.

A Young Lady of fifteen usually didn’t have power to allocate vacant abodes for their personal guests. That was the case for Bhela, whose family had largely fell in control of Elder Jhamil’s influence. But the main Malikh bloodline had their supporters of their own. Albeit being suppressed, these supporters still did have some leniency if it was to provide empty houses at their Young Lady’s command. Worst came to worst they’d lend out their private second home that was still in good condition. Thanks for the support of the main bloodline supporter faction, which led by Elder Khasim, Bhela managed to pull some strings to let Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington rest comfortably in Malikh Family.

On another time, this happened when Young Master Blackwood happily waiting for his own dream; Madame Sylvia stopped Bhela on the way to the vacant house. Mister Harrington also was standing by with his arms crossed, looking at the girl. Bhela knew the two had made sure nobody would listen to them here in the empty corridor for them to stop her with those solemn faces.

Madame Sylvia opened her mouth. “Tell us honestly, girl, what kind of faction you would like to join in?”

Bhela looked at the woman with a flash of determination in her eyes.

“Someplace within one or two days of travel from here.” They asked her to be honest, so she said just that.

“You…” Madame Sylvia was speechless, even Mister Harrington groaning at the girl’s naivety. Madam Sylvia said, “Don’t you know it takes a whole month for us to return to our schools by carriage?”

“Yes. But isn’t the thing that kept you busy here almost completed, Madame Sylvia?”

“What thing?”

“Setting up your school’s southern branch,” Bhela said.

Mister Harrington, who had enough, harrumphed. “So you’re saying that you--the first person who had an Unique Class with four elemental affinity, should just study in a mere sect’s branch?”

Bhela looked at Mister Harrington apolegically. “Wouldn’t you need high-achiever locals to manage your branch in the future?”

“I need a talent who has an affinity with the four elements, not a talent to manage a damn branch!”

Madame Sylvia waved her sleeve to tell the man to calm down. Mister Harrington went back crossing his arms with a snort.

“I’m sorry Mister Harrington, I’m sorry Madame Sylvia; you might know from the Ngajen Ceremony that my father had been ill, so I’m not in position to study far away like my friend Young Lady Elzhier.”

Madame Sylvia furrowed her brows. Even Mister Harrington stopped his scowling expression after Bhela said the name.

Madame Sylvia slowly inquired, “This Young Lady Ryntia Elzhier, your friend, was she the one who managed to get you a slot during the seminars?”

“Yes, Sister Ryntia did ask a favor from a friend she knew working in the management.”

Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington looked at each other.

“Tsk. This girl, does she really not know anything?” Mister Harrinton said.

“Girl,” Madame Sylvia spoke, “neither Harrington and I are someone who could be moved by mere favors. Personally instructing you is an order from our higher ups. We initially have our own schedule to talk during the seminars but all those were cancelled just so that we could follow your caravan.”

Her words implicate something, but Mister Harrington then made it clearer.

“To assign the expert on archery and the most knowledgeable theorist on elemental affinity to teach a single girl. And here this lass thought her friend was being nice to her, tsk tsk. Does she also think us professionals wouldn’t know her real Class if there’s no one helping her wrapping it up under secret?”

“Sis Ryntia really did really say I could choose my own place to attend,” Bhela said. Even so, she kept being persistent on having them considering her.

“I know Ryntia Elzhier.”

Madame Sylvia spoke as her gaze became more solemn.

“I didn’t think anything when I heard of Elzhier Family living in this village before but after looking back how mysterious your backing during the seminars is then it all starting to make sense,” Madame Sylvia said with a sigh. “Listen, girl; that sect where the friend of yours living in has something in common in their policy dealing for external affairs: give and take. They give you so much, do you really think they won’t be coming to take something from you?”

After being said like that, it was clear that no other sects or schools would be capable to take her anymore should they learn what Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington knew tonight.

“Dawdle no longer, let’s go! I want to shut my eyes close,” Mister Harrington began walking again.

The vacant house they were going to was already near, so Bhela only gave the direction and Mister Harrington quickly left both the females behind. Madame Sylvia walked with her side by side, looking at Bhela’s face who was slightly perturbed by the recent discussions.

“Don’t be frowning too much, we’re at least going to stay here for a while to keep that ignorant young noble from harassing you too much,” Madame Sylvia said, then added, “not that he could do anything to you though.”

Bhela thought of her mother’s tears as she accused Blackwood Family backing Elder Jhamil to poison her father and took over the family. She didn’t say any of that to Madame Sylvia. “Thank you,” she said, unlike her usual demeanor, sounded as quiet as a timid girl.

Kurusiya came back to the lonesome shop managed by Elzhier Family.

One would think that the noisy shopkeeper would be the one who greet him. It changed, however, as a beautiful woman now tended the unassuming shop. Her manner was serene, her clothes were proper, but still it couldn’t hide the bewitching voluptuous figure of hers. Before her, the lone customer who was also a woman, lazily drinking tuaq from a decorated cup that should be used to serve pricey wine. She was even more beauty than the current shopkeeper lady. Any man would gladly sell their dignity to drink alongside these beauties, but Kurusiya wasn’t one of them. He picked a place to sit wordlessly. Seeing that the ladies acting as they didn’t see him, he greeted, “Elder Sheyla.”

The beautiful customer, the one Kurusiya talked to, smiled. Kurusiya was well aware he needed to act cautiously however friendly her smile was. She was an elder of Elzhier Family, one of the female figures in the Elzhier, but he knew the other job she had when not wearing Elzhier’s crest.

The shopkeeper lady finally looked at him. Though with her back resting on the wall and her mind on the tobacco she blowing, the shopkeeper lady asked him nonetheless, “You’re prowling around in Elzhier Family instead return back to Yashura Family. It made us girls wonder you’re trying to get laid with one of our sisters.”

Kururisya looked at the woman, patiently replied, “Yulong got his hand full watching out for that Nalaq. Best to not complicate things with me staying out of Yashura Family.”

“Oho,” the woman giggled, ignoring his excuse, “or is it mine attention you’re trying to get? Sorry, but, you’re no longer young enough to get benefits out of our friendship.”

Kurusiya didn’t bother to respond to the shopkeeper lady’s teasing. The lady giggled again. One of her arms now resting below her loaded breasts, which was irresistibly big, her weapons she was proud of that enabled her to befriend many males from great variances of ages and handsomeness. She didn’t believe Kurusiya would still be able to keep his poker face after she showed off her prized tits. Frowning, Kurusiya made it known that he never liked this big breasted vixen. Only ignorant men who weren’t aware of the lady’s real age would be allured with this kind of cheap move.

The lady customer, Elder Sheyla, sitting poured tuaq into a new glass, sliding it over Kurusiya’s side.

“What’s this?” he asked.

Elder Sheyla said, “Take that as our condolences for having you rushing here. After all, travelling out of nowhere dessert alone in a hurry isn’t a trivial feat.”

Kurisiya drank the tuaq in one gulp. He didn’t want to ask why these women knew his previous location even though it supposed to be a secret.

The beautiful elder continued, “But it’s true it has become our attention that you were poking around for us in Elzhier Family’s establishments. Tell us, Kurusiya, what are you trying to get from us sister?”

“I’m looking for the one who’s responsible for Ghalim’s poison.”

Elder Sheyla merely smiled. And the lady behind the counter chuckled mockingly.

There was no change in Kurusiya expression. “Well, are you?”

“We’re not.”

Kurusiya gave Elder Sheyla a look and asked again, “Ghalim’s got poisoned the same time you foxes got closer to his daughter and sponsored her through various seminars. Even a dumb fella hearing this wouldn’t think it as a coincidence.”

“It’s really a coincidence,” Elder Sheyla maintained a calm poise with her smile. “Besides, no matter how far and wide our network is, acquiring Jhuro’s personal poison is an impossible matter for us sisters to do.”

“So you know it’s Jhuro’s poison.”

Elder Sheyla kept smiling, not denying the accusation. However the shopkeeper lady had enough. “Why don’t you check your own men instead of running around here?”

“The kids wouldn’t dare to sneak around us old bloods,” Kurusiya said coldly.

The shopkeeper lady sneered.

“Do you think your people can still throwing your weight around just like in the past? Yashura’s great grandfather doesn’t even bother managing his family, your Jhuro can’t even say he is confident enough that he needs you to protect him all the time. What’s there to fear about your Yashura Family anymore? I’m not surprised if some guy comes out to teach you a lesson one of these days.”

Seeing that Kurusiya was speechless to refute, the shopkeeper lady was pleased. But she quickly realized her words not only offend Kurusiya, but also Elder Sheyla that she supposed to accompany tonight. When it came to Yashura Family there was one thing that shouldn’t be said in front of Elder Sheyla, realizing she just broke that one, the shopkeeper lady wanted to retract the mockery she said just now. But she was too embarrassed to admit her wrong in front of Kurusiya. This incurred a deeper frown from Elder Sheyla.

“Put whatever Mister Kurusiya ordered to my tab,” the beautiful elder said to the shopkeeper, stood up, then glanced at Kurusiya, said to him, “we really have nothing to do with the poison. Our dealing in regard of Young Lady Bhela’s seminar attendance already received Old Madam Malikh’s approval. Everything else has nothing to do with us.”

Seeing that Elder Sheyla about to leave, Kurusiya insisted, “Even though Old Madam Malikh’s men in Malikh Family’s elder council suddenly fell ill and ran into various accidents?”

“Old Madam Malikh would send people to raze our door if that’s our doing.” Elder Sheyla reached the door. One last thing, she turned her head and said, “Why don’t you investigate Blackwood Family instead, hmm? They’re sending money to Jhamil Malikh. I think they are quite suspicious.”

“As if ignorant outsiders have the capability to deal with Old Madam Malikh’s men,” Kurusiya refuted.

“Outsiders?” Elder Sheyla laughed, almost a shrill. “Are you sure?”

Kurusiya didn’t know why Elder Sheyla suddenly acting as if she was mocking him like this. He didn’t have the chance to inquire further, however, as Elder Sheyla already gone the moment she lazily waved her hand goodbye.

“She’s sulking,” the shopkeeper lady said, gazing at the door with complicated eyes.

Kurusiya gave her an eye. “Because of you.”

The shopkeeper lady couldn’t say anything to that.

Kurusiya saw Elder Sheyla left the bottle of tuaq she drank from on the counter. He wouldn’t be so shy to act shameless towards these Elzhiers, so he helped himself pouring his glass more alcohol. But then he realized the leftover tuaq didn’t ever cover the half of his glass.

“Elder Sheyla paid for me,” he raised his glass, “fill me more tuaq.”

The shopkeeper lady gave a professional smile. “I think you misunderstood, dear customer, we are a legal and upstanding establishment. We don’t sell anything dubious like alcohol in here.”

Then what was the liquor he drank just now? Kurusiya groaned.

Sure enough, this sect’s women who idle enough to play shopkeeper and maidservants in Elzhier Family were annoying. That silly shopkeeper from previously who only knew how to brag looked more pleasing to the eyes compared to this vixen standing before him.
